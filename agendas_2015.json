Therefore, it has been necessary to hire a consultant to download and analyze the City\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims and financial data, and prepare the required analyses and reports.

That said, staff verified the RFP was distributed to qualified firms and surveyed vendors for feedback on the limited response.

Administrative Proceedings", "Recommendations": "Staff recommends that the City Council uphold appeal 15ENT-0321 and approve ARB 14-173 for building, design, colors, materials, landscaping and lighting plans for a new 271-room hotel and 15, 210 square feet of ground floor retail/restaurant space at 710 Wilshire Boulevard, subject to findings and conditions contained in this staff report.", "Body": ["Executive Summary", "The proposed project is a new 271-room hotel that includes the retention and adaptive reuse of a City Landmark office building (Santa Monica Professional Building), a bridge connection between the Landmark building and the new hotel building, and 15,210 sf of ground floor retail/restaurant space. The development agreement for the proposed project was approved on March 20, 2012 with eight design conditions.", "In anticipation of the need to obtain both a Certificate of Appropriateness for alterations to the Landmark building and Architectural Review Board approval for the new hotel building, Section 6.1 of the development agreement between the City and Maxser and Company (07DEV006) established the Joint Design Review Body (JDRB), a design review body consisting of four Landmarks Commission members and three Architectural Review Board members. The JDRB has exclusive design review jurisdiction over the project including the rehabilitation of the Landmark building and the design of the new hotel building. Decisions made by the JDRB are appealable only to the City Council. The development agreement was also approved prior to the effective date of the recently adopted zoning ordinance and, therefore, the JDRB follows the procedures and findings established in the prior Architectural Review ordinance (Chapter 9.32 of the zoning code in effect at the time of the project\u2019s approval). As a result, the Council is acting as the JDRB in its de novo review of the ARB application and must determine whether the proposed project meets the findings required for approval of the ARB application identified in SMMC Section 9.32.140.", "The JDRB reviewed the project on June 30, 2014 (Attachment A), September 29, 2014 (Attachment B) and September 28, 2015 (Attachment C). On September 28, 2015, the JDRB voted 7-0 to approve Certificate of Appropriateness 14CA-012 and voted 5-2 to deny ARB application 14ARB173. In its review of ARB application 14ARB173 over the course of the two prior meetings, the Board reacted positively to the landscape palette, the revised color palette unifying the project, opening up the entrance to the paseo on Wilshire Boulevard and 7th Street, and the effort made to give the new construction its own architectural personality but indicated that the positive changes were still diminished by the proposed smooth plaster finish and generic detailing of the building.", "The applicant, Alexander Gorby, owner of Maxser and Company, addressed each of the JDRB\u2019s outstanding issues by making substantial changes to the building design and materials including eliminating use of the smooth finish plaster and replacing with custom-color Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete (GFRC) without any exterior treatment. The applicant also removed the podium level of the new construction and replaced it with outdoor space and a storefront glazing system. Floor area was also removed from the East elevation breaking up the building mass and resulting in the loss of four hotel rooms from the original proposal.", "In denying 14ARB173, the JDRB found that the new hotel building lacks a clear architectural concept demonstrated by the conflicting ideas present in the materiality, openings, and building form (Attachment D). Specifically, the Board indicated that the curvilinear forms appeared foreign to the overall design of the new hotel building and had concerns regarding the permanency of the fiber-reinforced polymer entry canopy. The bridge connection between the Landmark and new hotel building also appeared unresolved in terms of its design and connection between the two buildings. The GFRC panels, generic fenestration, and balcony patterns emphasized the size and expansiveness of the building on all elevations. In particular, the breaks in the building mass and color differentiation on the East Elevation were not sufficient to reduce the perceived mass of the new hotel building and its compatibility with development in the surrounding area.", "The applicant, Alexander Gorby, filed an appeal of the JDRB\u2019s denial of ARB14-173 on October 6, 2015 (Attachment E). The JDRB\u2019s denial was primarily based on three key issues including the lack of an architectural concept, concerns about the East elevation, and bridge connection details. Staff believes that the applicant has sufficiently addressed the concerns raised by the JDRB throughout the review process in addition to the eight design conditions imposed by the Council in the approval of the development agreement. Specifically, the design of the new hotel building provides a complementary reference to the layers and sculptural quality of the Landmark building. The dark blue stucco background colour contrasts with the custom grey palette of the GFRC panels. The curvilinear architectural forms of the new hotel building occurs at transition points from each elevation and combined with the fenestration pattern further provide a continuous architectural theme throughout the building design. The East elevation has been significantly improved through breaking down the building mass into five distinct vertical bays separated by 12-foot wide openings. Variation in color and texture further animates the elevation. The overall pedestrian orientation of the project has also been improved through the introduction of a continuous storefront glazing system on the 7th Street elevation that has allowed for an expanded opening into the retail paseo and seamless transitions between the indoor hotel lobby and retail space and adjacent outdoor dining and pedestrian zone. The 7th Street elevation is highlighted by a prominent curved entry canopy. The only connection between the Landmark and new hotel building is a bridge at the podium level. The bridge consists of a steel material with glass railings and a steel trowel stucco underside. The bridge walkway would have a terrazzo finish. The visual representation of the bridge connection is mitigated by the transparency of the glass railing material.", "As a result, staff believes that the project meets each of the required ARB findings and recommends that the subject appeal be upheld. If the appeal is upheld, the applicant would move forward to the plan check process in order to obtain a building permit for the project. The Council may also deny the appeal with or without prejudice. If the appeal is denied with prejudice, the applicant would be required to file a new ARB application for a project design that is not substantially the same as the prior project and seek JDRB approval of the revised ARB application. The Council\u2019s action on the subject appeal is final.", "Background", "The development agreement for the proposed project was approved by the City Council on March 20, 2012 (Attachment F).  The applicant also made courtesy presentations on the building design to the Landmarks Commission on three separate occasions: May 11, 2009 (Attachment G), April 12, 2010 (Attachment H), and December 12, 2011 (Attachment I). The discussion on the project focused around the project\u2019s compatibility with the Landmark building and concerns that: 1) the project should reference but not overly replicate the forms and proportions of the Landmark building and 2) that the new hotel building overwhelmed the Landmark in terms of volume, mass, and height.", "The development agreement included unique provisions that were intended to provide a framework for JDRB review of the project including review parameters and specific design areas to pay particular attention. These conditions also guide Council\u2019s de novo review of the ARB application.", "Section 6.1.5 of the development agreement states that the JDRB cannot require modifications to the building design which negate the fundamental development standards established by the development agreement (e.g. reduction in overall height or reduction in number of stories). The JDRB also cannot take action that has the effect of requiring elimination of a physical connection between the Landmark building and the new hotel building. However, the JDRB does have authority to reduce the floor area of the project by no greater than 2%.", "As part of its review of the development agreement, Council imposed the following conditions of approval that relate to JDRB review of the project:", "\u201cThe Joint Design Review Body shall pay particular attention to the following design elements of the project:", "\u00b7 The south elevation stair tower to ensure that it provides visual interest", "\u00b7 The south elevation above the hotel vehicle entrance to ensure that the proposed green wall is composed of a high quality material.

In particular, the breaks in the building mass and color differentiation on the East Elevation were not sufficient to reduce the perceived mass of the new hotel building and its compatibility with development in the surrounding area.", "Staff believes that the project meets the required ARB findings as detailed in Attachment K and therefore, recommends that the appeal be upheld. As detailed in this report, staff believes that the key issues raised in the JDRB\u2019s denial of the ARB application in terms of architectural concept, the East Elevation, and the bridge connection have been sufficiently addressed by the applicant. The architectural elements of the new hotel building provide a contemporary reference to the layers and sculptural quality of the Landmark building without creating a false sense of historicism. The new hotel building provides a complementary and sensitive backdrop to the Landmark building by providing a significant building setback on Wilshire Boulevard, building insets on 7th Street, and breaks in the building mass on the East elevation that all reduce the perceived mass of the new hotel building.", "The East elevation is broken up into five vertical bays that bring the building to the ground and allow the elevation to read as distinct building masses. The custom gray color palette for the GFRC panels contrast against a dark blue stucco background with a lighter blue applied to the fiber-reinforced polymer entrance canopy. The use of color is particularly effective on the East elevation to distinguish between each vertical bay and emphasizes the breaks in the building mass.", "The only connection between the Landmark and new hotel building is a bridge at the podium level. The bridge consists of a steel material with glass railings and a steel trowel stucco underside. The bridge walkway would have a terrazzo finish.

In its review of the project, the Architectural Review Board should pay particular attention to the ground floor frontage of the East Building facing Colorado Avenue to ensure a pedestrian-oriented design; and to the roof deck canopy and pedestrian bridges between the buildings as they relate to horizontal expansiveness and perception of fa\u00e7ade length along the Colorado Avenue elevation. The applicant has agreed to this recommendation and the conditions of approval have been updated. [Project Specific Condition of Approval No. 2]", "4. The bike storage location should be revisited to make it as convenient and accessible as possible. Bicycle parking is proposed at-grade for short-term bike parking and within the subterranean parking garage for long-term bike storage. The long-term bike storage location is conveniently located near the residential elevators, and is a more secure and preferred location for this purpose than relocating it to the ground floor level.

Discussions with the applicant regarding this item highlighted the operational difficulties related to providing private storage units since space within the project is limited. There are 63 units that are under 800 square feet in the project. The applicant indicates that when storage spaces are provided, they are often charged separately from the unit and provided above a designated parking space or in areas of the garage where there is room to provide storage.

The project includes a proportionally higher number of 1BR and studio units, as compared to other unit sizes, and provides a reasonable number of affordable 2BR and 3BR units. As proposed, among recently approved projects, this project would be the first to provide an affordable 3BR unit at a deep level of affordability (50% of AMI). The provision of an additional studio unit for moderate income level households would be the only affordable studio unit in the project, would provide an affordability mix that is more consistent with the proposed unit mix, and would provide a unit in the project that is affordable to a potential pool of Downtown workers.

As applied to this project, the portion of the West Building between 55 and 60 feet is the 5th floor of the building. As proposed, an increase of building height from 55 to 57 feet is a 3.6% increase, and therefore a corresponding 3.6% decrease in floor area on the 5th floor is required.", "The average size of floors 2-4 of the West Building is 9,562 square feet, with the 4th floor consisting of 9,863 square feet. The proposed 5th floor totals 9,123 square feet in area, which represents a 7 percent decrease in floor area from the immediate floor below. As proposed, the top floor is reduced in size relative to the general building footprint and massing of the project above the podium level, and is therefore consistent with this requirement.", "The draft DSP also addresses building volume of upper floors; however it approaches the reduction of upper level massing differently. The stepback requirements historically used by the City have been replaced in the Draft DSP with limitations on floor plate ratios as compared to the floors below and limiting the length of primary fa\u00e7ade that occupies the building frontage zone six feet from the frontage line of the upper floors. More specifically, the overall size of the upper floors is limited, but its specific location along the upper floors is flexible (i.e. moveable across the entire floor). This flexibility allows specific site characteristics to be considered in the design phase that could result in optimizing benefits such as natural sunlight into internal courtyards, roof deck location, site uniqueness, and overall design quality within a case-by-case setting. In this instance, the building design wraps around the north, east, and west elevations in a manner that allows for optimal natural sunlight to enter the internal courtyard and south-facing units while limiting building massing at the building frontage and reducing the overall upper level massing as intended by the draft DSP. The applicable maximum floor plate ratios for this project identified in the draft DSP are 90% for the 3rd floor, 75% for the 4th floor, and 55% for the 5th floor.

Table 3 below compares the proposed project with the minimum vehicular and bicycle parking requirements of the Zoning Ordinance (effective July 24, 2015) and the draft DSP. The Zoning Ordinance requires one parking space per 500 square feet of floor area for retail and restaurant uses below 2,500 square feet in size. The required parking ratios increase to 1/300 and 1/200 for retail and restaurant uses larger than 2,500 square feet in size, respectively.", "It is uncertain how the 10,617 square-foot commercial space will be subdivided and what types of uses will occupy the ground floor, but evaluation of the parking plan should consider the provision of sufficient parking to allow flexibility in the type and size of uses. Evaluating parking at only a 1/500 parking ratio would potentially place unnecessary constraints on the parking supply and limit the opportunity to combine tenant spaces to accommodate larger uses. Conversely, evaluating the parking at only a 1/200 parking ratio could potentially result in too much parking being required for the project.

In researching other multi-family residential projects around the country that have installed greywater systems, such projects tended to be on average 250 units, had obtained sizeable grants from a public utility, or were no longer using the greywater system due to maintenance difficulties. In speaking with manufacturers of greywater systems, it became clear that the cost of maintenance and regulatory compliance due to water testing could be substantial. Further, the City has not yet developed a regulatory framework that would provide appropriate oversight for testing of greywater systems. Given the uncertainty in ensuring the long-term success of a greywater system in the project, staff ultimately decided that a contribution that represented what it would cost to install a greywater system would be more effective in bringing the use of greywater in the City to fruition. The contribution could assist the City in studying the feasibility of greywater systems and also be a source of potential grants for partners who are interested in pilot projects for greywater systems.", "The negotiated water conservation contribution was not originally intended to address water demand offsets for purposes of water neutrality, but instead was intended to represent the potential cost of installing a greywater system for toilet flushing in a project.

In discussion with the City\u2019s Public Works Department, it was determined that the project would be responsible for the collection of stormwater runoff from westward sheetflow on the southern half of Colorado Avenue; however, the placement of a bioswale along Colorado Avenue is infeasible due to the existing subsurface utilities and the lack of available space created by this condition. An alternative bioswale system on the Lincoln Boulevard frontage was explored that would capture the runoff on Colorado Avenue and pipe it across the property through a diversion facility to the potential bioswale area on Lincoln Boulevard for treatment and infiltration. This alternative was also determined to be infeasible due to a Southern California Edison (SCE) easement along the entire Colorado Avenue frontage that prohibits any infrastructure from traversing the easement.

The information-gathering process included a series of 11 community forums, a month-long city-wide survey, a retreat and meetings with the Library Board and 14 updating sessions with Library staff. Two hundred one people attended and gave feedback at community forums held in each neighborhood library. Special community forums were held at the Boys and Girls Club, with the Library\u2019s Teen Advisory Committee, with community leaders, with youth at the Pico Library and middle school students to obtain the thoughts and opinions from students ages 11 - 18.

Addressing a host of community concerns, the emerging Plan aims to balance the desire for near-term placemaking improvements with long-range capital investments to the street right-of-way, and seeks to engage the local business community in supporting and/or managing a more functional, aesthetically pleasing pedestrian experience. The following streetscape, transportation network enhancements, and business improvement concepts were developed through a public outreach process that has involved residents from Ocean Park, Sunset Park and Pico neighborhoods, as well as local businesses, property owners, the School district, social service organizations, and bicycle and pedestrian advocates. Staff has also involved a wide array of City departments to help identify and resolve key issues and concerns.", "The concepts included in this report have been discussed by the Planning Commission, the Architectural Review Board, the Urban Forest Task Force, the Chamber of Commerce and the community at-large. A recent public workshop and online public participation platform have generated comments that support many of the project components. Based on City Council direction, staff will continue to integrate project elements into a comprehensive corridor plan that includes a technically accurate streetscape plan, recommendations for enhancing the transportation network, and guidebooks for private property and business improvement. A final public workshop will be held in January 2016 for the purpose of selecting the preferred streetscape alternative. Following the community meeting, project costs, phasing strategies, and Plan recommendations will be completed prior to returning to the Planning Commission and City Council to approve the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan.", "Background", "The 2010 LUCE described the strategic opportunity to implement streetscape, transportation and land use improvements on Lincoln Boulevard through coordinated, multi-disciplinary efforts (section 2.4-65) at the time that the Boulevard was relinquished by Caltrans to the City of Santa Monica. LUCE goals and policies related to Lincoln Boulevard describe the need to prepare a streetscape masterplan (Policy B26.1), improve pedestrian crosswalks (Policy B26.2), enhance transit ridership and capacity (Policies B26.3, B26.4), and encourage a more cohesive public realm experience through fa\u00e7ade improvements (Policy B25.1), sidewalk amenities and outdoor dining (Policies B25.5, B25.14), and additional neighborhood serving businesses (Goal B25).", "Caltrans relinquished Lincoln Boulevard to the City of Santa Monica in 2012, which stimulated public and private interests in addressing deferred maintenance issues and in fulfilling the vision of the LUCE for a more walkable and aesthetically pleasing corridor. In 2013, the Public Works Department completed a street resurfacing and striping project that improved vehicular operations and laid the groundwork for future transit efficiency by modifying right-of-way striping to accommodate potential dedicated bus lanes. The resurfacing project improved the visual condition of Lincoln Boulevard, but left more substantive streetscape modifications (such as medians or crosswalks), policy recommendations and other enhancements to the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan.", "On June 10, 2014 the City Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a contract (CCS #9915) with Community Design and Architecture to prepare a detailed streetscape and transit concept for Lincoln Boulevard between the I-10 Freeway and the City limits at Ozone Avenue. Additionally, the concept was to be complemented with a variety of business improvement activities ranging from common-sense and easily implementable projects, like the installation of planters adjacent to local businesses, to longer term initiatives such as the formation of a Business Improvement District, possibly in coordination with the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce. To accomplish the project\u2019s objectives, a consultant team is supporting staff in the areas of urban design and planning, transportation planning and transit enhancements, economic analysis and business improvement, and public realm enhancements.", "The project area is located along 17 blocks of Lincoln Boulevard from the I-10 Freeway (including the bridge overpass) to Ozone Avenue, approximately 1.25 miles long in each direction. The project boundaries include the vehicular right-of-way, as well as the public sidewalk and the ground floor of buildings that front Lincoln Blvd.", "It is envisioned that the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan will result in a comprehensive framework for the overall enhancement of the Boulevard, and will weave together phased physical design improvements to the streetscape and right-of-way with policy and program level recommendations for balancing vehicle flow and demand. Envisioned to be a mixed-mode and livable street environment for pedestrians, transit and vehicles, the ability for bicycles to coexist with other modes on this busy boulevard has also been explored. Once complete, or even before if Council desires, portions of the Plan could be implemented incrementally as private and public funding allows creating a high quality streetscape and pedestrian environment that removes existing barriers, expands accessibility, increases pedestrian comfort, and improves public health.", "Project Goals and Objectives", "Over the past 10 years, outreach and planning efforts have informed the goals for the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan. Starting with the community-wide development of the LUCE, to more recent efforts from local interests groups such as the multi-neighborhood Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce, the following goals and objectives have guided the development of the streetscape, transit and business improvement concepts:", "Streetscape Goals", "1. Reduce Barriers to Pedestrian Access and Comfort: reduce or eliminate potential conflicts between vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. Increase the number of crossings to promote pedestrian and bicycle movements across the boulevard and into the neighborhoods. Improve sidewalks with amenities that would encourage more walking.", "2. Improve Connections to Destinations: ameliorate congested and unsightly points of interchange, and improve wayfinding and legibility to key destinations like Santa Monica High School, the Beach and Downtown.", "3. Improve and Diversify Landscaping and Tree Canopy: complement existing tree inventory with new trees that offer biodiversity and visual interest. Enhance parkway landscaping and optimize opportunities for stormwater infiltration and capture.", "Transportation Network Goals", "1. Maintain and Improve Vehicle Flow: maintain and improve vehicle flow for the 40,000-50,000 motorists who use Lincoln Blvd. as a primary north/south commuting corridor. Limit potential for cut-through traffic.", "2. Enhance Transit Ridership and Efficiency: pursue strategies, including peak hour dedicated bus lanes, to increase Big Blue Bus ridership, as well as corridor travel times for transit users.", "Business Improvement Goals", "1. Enhance Land Use Offerings Serving Daily Needs: maintain and attract pedestrian-oriented uses such as restaurants, cafes, markets and neighborhood services. Support existing auto-oriented uses that provide valuable services to the community.", "2. Support Fa\u00e7ade Maintenance and Public Realm Improvements: provide guidance for the adaptive reuse and repurposing of aging buildings. Assist with public realm concepts that appeal to pedestrians and help improve curb appeal.", "3. Help Create a Cohesive Business Community: assist in the formation of a formal or informal merchant association, and demonstrate benefit of coordinated marketing campaigns, events, advocacy groups that support the Lincoln Boulevard businesses.", "Public Participation and Community Outreach", "In collaboration with multi-departmental staff, the project team has worked with a wide range of constituents to develop streetscape, transportation and business improvement concepts. Neighborhood leaders communicate frequently with staff through the Lincoln Boulevard Taskforce which includes representation from the Ocean Park, Sunset Park and Pico neighborhoods, as well as from the Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District. Outreach is considered an integral part of the design and plan formation process, using group feedback and stakeholder input as a means for vetting ideas and generating support for key concepts or assessing prevailing attitudes towards Plan recommendations. As the backbone of the design process, the outreach effort has involved the following efforts to date:", "Stakeholder Interviews and Focus Groups. Dozens of one-on-one or group interviews with local businesses have been held since September 2014. Focus group events have centered on key topics, such as signage and code compliance, outdoor dining and display of merchandise, landscape maintenance, or other public realm and process issues that Lincoln Blvd. businesses often cite as concerns. Recent focus groups have begun to focus on the formation of a Business Improvement District and the identification of small, short-term projects that local businesses can sponsor to improve the sidewalk environment and pedestrian experience.", "Community Workshops: two community workshops have been conducted during which participants have explored the range of issues, concerns and ideas surrounding the Boulevard.", "\u00b7  The first workshop, held on February 23rd, 2015 involved the presentation of over 30 streetscape, transit and business improvement elements, as well as a facilitated discussion about the merits and benefits of each.

It also approaches implementation opportunistically such that some Plan components can be realized almost immediately, while others will require greater process and capital investment. In concert with the LUCE vision for a more functional neighborhood corridor, the Plan is developing a technically accurate streetscape concept that is mostly capital intensive, but includes several items that will not require a great deal of process or expenditure. Simultaneously, strategies and recommendations for stimulating the local business community are being refined, and outreach to property owners and residents is creating partnerships for revitalizing the Boulevard through future fa\u00e7ade improvements, public art, landscaping, and event programming.", "The emerging streetscape design seeks to orchestrate several complex circulation functions, improving vehicle and transit flow, and increasing the presence of pedestrians and pedestrian-serving businesses along this busy corridor. The complementary business improvement program and beautification effort intends to work from the inside out, supporting local businesses to mature in place and to act as stewards of the street.

At that workshop, participants demonstrated their preference for streetscape concepts in the Pedestrian Life category, which identified a range of improvements to the pedestrian experience for residents, shoppers and visitors. In this category, workshop participants overwhelmingly prioritized medians. New crosswalks, pedestrian lighting, additional street trees, and freeway bridge pedestrian enhancements were also top priorities.", "Since the February workshop, the project team has refined and integrated the concepts into a larger corridor length streetscape design. During the design process, each block has been individually analyzed for opportunities to accommodate the features that are desired by the community, and which support the goals of the project. The following are brief descriptions of the design features incorporated to date:", "Main Streetscape Features:", "\u00b7 New landscaped center medians, 10\u2019 average width, various lengths", "\u00b7 New crosswalks with pedestrian-actuated signalization across Lincoln Boulevard located at Grant, Pine, and Wilson/Pier Streets", "\u00b7 New crosswalk striping at 23 side street locations", "\u00b7 New pedestrian lighting spaced at 50-75\u2019 intervals", "\u00b7 New street trees in existing and/or future parkways and potentially in medians", "\u00b7 Refreshed landscaping in existing parkways, and potentially dozens of new parkway locations", "\u00b7 Potential for new permeable street pavers in sidewalk locations where parkways are not feasible or desired", "\u00b7 Tree well enhancements such as mulch, ground cover or possibly very low water-use plantings", "\u00b7 New curb-extensions and bulb-outs at strategically located side streets and in certain areas on Lincoln Blvd. north of Pico Blvd.", "\u00b7 New Peak Hour Directional 12\u2019 Dedicated Bus Lanes", "\u00b7 New bike racks, benches and trash receptacles", "\u00b7 Eliminated unused curb-cuts and revised curb ramps", "\u00b7 Wayfinding Signage and Markers", "B. TRANSPORTATION NETWORK ENHANCEMENTS", "At the February 23rd workshop, participants demonstrated their preference for transportation concepts that identified improvements to the flow of vehicles and public transit, reducing travel times and congestion. At that meeting, and in subsequent outreach, dedicated peak period bus lanes were extensively supported, and in fact garnered the most support of any of the 30+ concepts presented at the workshop. Bicycle connectors that would help cyclists cross Lincoln Boulevard from established bicycle routes within the residential neighborhoods were popular as well.", "Since the February workshop, the project team has integrated transportation enhancements into the emerging streetscape plan in order to support the goals of the project, which include improving vehicle and transit flow, as well as increasing ridership. Based on in-depth analysis on the applicability and benefits of proposed transportation enhancements, such as dedicated bus lanes on Lincoln Boulevard, the following are recommended for incorporation into the streetscape design and striping plan:", "\u00b7 Peak Hour Dedicated Bus Lane", "o Peak Hour Conversion of 12\u2019 Parking Lane to Directional Bus-only Lane", "o Northbound AM, Southbound PM", "o Curbside Lane Configuration to Accommodate Existing BBB vehicles", "o Travel Time Savings of Approximately 10 Minutes Within Santa Monica", "o Potential Travel Time Savings of 25+ Minutes if Extended to Green Line Station (coordination with LADOT is ongoing)", "\u00b7 Bicycle Connectors", "o Pearl Street", "o Ashland Street", "C. BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT/BEAUTIFICATION", "Participants in the LiNC project have demonstrated an interest in seeing local businesses assist the City in promoting Lincoln Boulevard as a neighborhood commercial corridor. Since the initial February workshop, the project team has worked diligently to strengthen relationships with the business community, and has developed a series of short-term conceptual projects that could be implemented by local businesses on their own, or with some form of City assistance. In addition to these tactical improvements, the work on forming a merchant\u2019s association and ultimately a Business Improvement District has attracted a dedicated steering committee of local property and business owners that is focused on the formation of a property-based BID.

IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPT", "Because the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan includes such a diverse range of streetscape, transportation network and business improvement activities, a linear phasing program is unlikely. Certain aspects of the Plan will require capital investments, such as many of the proposed streetscape enhancements, while others that are low-cost and low process, such as select placemaking activities, could be moved forward more quickly. Coordination among the various elements \u2013 whether they are implemented today or in five years \u2013 is essential to ensure a cohesive aesthetic experience along Lincoln Boulevard. The ensuing contents of this report map out preliminary phasing options based on available resources, willing participants, length of process, depth of investment and various other factors.", "Long-Term Implementation", "A defining feature of the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan is the evolving streetscape concept, which takes into account possible options for incorporating desired design features, such as crosswalks and medians, into the roadway network in order to support better vehicle flow, increased pedestrian and bicycle comfort, and enhanced transit performance. Streetscapes by nature are typically capital intensive, requiring dedicated funding resources, staff involvement and coordination, as well as project mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of construction on residents, businesses and circulation.", "Currently, no funding sources have been directed to the future reconstruction of Lincoln Boulevard. Staff anticipates that the final Plan will include recommendations for implementing the streetscape plan using a variety of funding resources that include grants, local return money, and general funds. The Council may decide to fund construction of the entire streetscape plan at once, or in select phases over time. Further, final plans will need to not only be approved by the City Council, but by the Coastal Commission as well, as portions of Lincoln Boulevard fall within the boundaries of the Local Coastal Plan.", "Due to these realities, the following section describes the components that are considered for long-term or incremental implementation. While some of these elements may be potentially fast-tracked by Council, such as the Dedicated Bus Lanes which require very little financial investment to implement, most will require ongoing technical refinement and dedicated funding sources.", "Landscaped Center Medians", "Landscaped center medians would be provided along the Boulevard to provide a character defining feature for the street by replacing significant portions of asphalt with green open space. Medians would be located in selected areas that are currently striped as a corridor-length center turn lane, and where possible would abut existing and proposed crosswalks to provide a refuge for pedestrian to improve crossing comfort. Medians would be planted with a variety of landscape material that is conducive for an urban environment and drought tolerant. Working with the City\u2019s Urban Forest division and Public Works Department, the project team is exploring the opportunity to plant additional street trees and subterranean infiltration galleries in the medians given the presence of a major sewer main that runs directly beneath the centerline of the street at various depths.", "The project team has developed two alternatives (see ATTACHMENT C) that approach the incorporation of medians into the streetscape design from distinct perspectives. These raise an important policy question for the Council to consider. The following are brief descriptions of the median design alternatives:", "\u00b7 Alternative A (approximately 1000 linear median feet): This median alternative locates center medians in areas along the Boulevard where left-turning movements onto un-signalized side-streets and private driveways are already prohibited. The benefit of this alternative is that there would be no change to the existing turning-movement profile on Lincoln Boulevard. Alternative A\u2019s disadvantage is that it yields a very limited amount of center medians due to the profundity of private driveways and un-signalized side-streets along the corridor.", "\u00b7 Alternative B (approximately 2000 linear median feet): This median alternative creates a more generous network of center medians at the expense of some left-turn movements onto selected low-volume side-streets and driveways. The benefit of this alternative is substantially more area available for landscaped center medians, as well as more consistent and predictable application of this treatment for incorporation into crosswalk design and pedestrian refuge island. Alternative B\u2019s disadvantage is that it may result in vehicles needing to complete a U-turn movement in some instances to access their desired destination. This treatment has been used successfully on Wilshire Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Ocean Park Boulevard and Ocean Avenue.", "At the August 6th, 2015 workshop, the project team facilitated a discussion with the audience over their preference for Alternative A or Alternative B after carefully explaining the tradeoffs of each design alternative. The discussion concluded with consensus that Alternative B was preferred, which reinforced the primary goal of creating a more pedestrian friendly corridor that unified the neighborhoods and businesses alike. The discussion about the median alternatives has been continued on the project\u2019s MySidewalk online public participation platform, and demonstrates a strong preference for Alternative B as well.", "Staff has evaluated the impact of Alternative B to vehicle flow (see Attachment H) on existing and future traffic scenarios (TDFM 2025 and 2030) using fresh 2015 AM and PM peak hour traffic counts and volumes at 25 intersections throughout the project area. Additionally, the project team conducted driveway tube counts at heavy trip generators, such as the former Haggen site and McDonald\u2019s, in order to understand the potential turning movement impacts of obstructing some private driveways with medians. The traffic study indicates that operationally, Lincoln Blvd. would function very similar to today with the median alternative, and that the traffic diverted by the medians is not high enough to cause impacts at any of the 25 study intersections. Typically, between 5 and 20 additional vehicles per hour would divert along the corridor due to the presence of medians, which would be negligible and likely imperceptible to vehicles using Lincoln.Further, the installation of medians on Lincoln Boulevard appears to improve operations at nearly every unsignalized intersection along the corridor.", "New Crosswalks", "Three new crosswalks are proposed at Grant, Pine and Wilson/Pier Streets to improve east/west connectivity. The addition of these three new crosswalks located at currently un-signalized intersections creates a consistent and predictable crossing pattern, approximately 600 feet (two blocks) between crossing opportunities. Crosswalks are proposed to be accompanied by alert devices to alert drivers to the presence of a pedestrian. The exact type of device is to be determined in future analysis, and will be coordinated with the recommendations of the Pedestrian Action Plan. The new crosswalks would be incorporated into landscaped medians in order to provide pedestrian refuges for safe harbor after managing one direction of traffic, and before taking on the next.", "Pedestrian Lighting", "Several upgrades are proposed to the existing lighting system in the emerging concept plan. Approximately 150 new 13-17 foot top-shielded lighting poles are proposed to encourage pedestrians to use the street in the evening. Pedestrian lighting is proposed at 50-75\u2019 intervals to supplement the existing lighting system. Existing street lights are proposed to be modified to include a pedestrian light that is directed to the sidewalk. The specific pole type and light head have not yet been identified, but community members have indicated a preference for a contemporary pole that has recently been installed on Colorado Avenue.", "Curb Extensions and Bulb-Outs", "The street design includes curb extensions and bulb-outs at select locations to enhance connectivity, landscaping and potential stormwater capture and to locate public art.", "Side-Street Curb Extensions", "Potential curb extensions have been identified at 9 locations where side streets meet Lincoln Blvd. These locations were selected based on several criteria, including available roadway width and their ability to capture, treat and infiltrate urban runoff, which will significantly add to citywide efforts to prevent pollutants from entering the Santa Monica Bay.", "\u00b7 East Side of Lincoln: Bay, Grant, Pacific, Cedar, and Hill Streets.", "\u00b7 West Side of Lincoln: Strand, Kensington, Cedar and Pier Streets.", "Lincoln Boulevard Curb Extensions", "The design of curb extensions on Lincoln Boulevard itself is largely driven by the conceptual boundaries of the proposed dedicated peak hour bus lane, as any physical expansion of the sidewalk into the parking lane would not allow the dedicated bus lanes to exist. The portion of Lincoln north of Bay Street, the northern terminus of the bus-only lanes, is thus the only area available for curb extensions on the Boulevard.These curb extensions could dramatically resolve long-standing pedestrian connectivity issues in an area heavily trafficked by high school students, which also suffers from an older roadway geometry near the I-10 Freeway ramp. Curb extensions are proposed at the following seven locations on Lincoln Boulevard:", "\u00b7 At Michigan Avenue and Pico Boulevards. These curb extensions are proposed on the eastern side of Lincoln Boulevard to reduce pedestrian crossing distance and to provide landscape and public art opportunities. Another curb extension is proposed for the western side of the Boulevard adjacent to the Shell gas station, for symmetry.", "\u00b7 At Olympic Boulevard (Freeway on-ramp). Two curb extensions are proposed on either side of Lincoln Boulevard, south of Olympic Boulevard. These would resolve non-conforming curb radii, which cause vehicle confusion and limit pedestrian comfort. Reducing the curb radii to a more standard dimension allows for a more direct crosswalk and a landscaped pedestrian refuge.", "At the August 6th, 2015 workshop, several comments about Lincoln curb-extensions were recorded. Chief among these concerns was to be careful when improving crossing potential at Olympic Boulevard, as significant resources have been already been spent on directing the flow of pedestrians and students to Michigan Avenue. Another concern was the elimination of a \u201cde facto\u201d right turn lane in a space that is currently marked with red curb at the Pico intersection. Staff is exploring these concerns.", "Eliminated Unused Curb Cuts", "The project team has conducted extensive field studies to evaluate the potential to reduce the prevalence of curb cuts along the project area and has identified a handful of sites where the concept plan will recommend closure. At approximately 10 locations, curb cuts are no longer in use by businesses and have been blockaded by steel fencing, or by a building with no access. The elimination of these 10 curb cuts can potentially reclaim approximately 400 feet of sidewalk for pedestrian use and parkway landscaping.", "Revised or New Curb Ramps for ADA Accessibility", "The base striping plan for the LiNC incorporates new ADA-compliant directional curb ramps at every side-street intersection and marked crosswalk location within the project area. Where feasible, the plan will incorporate dual directional curb ramps to provide additional comfort for all users.", "The Plant Palette: Parkway and Median Landscaping", "To \u201cgreen\u201d the Boulevard and soften the landscape, a variety of landscaping features are included in the streetscape design.

Approximately 3,500 linear feet of new parkways areas are considered, incorporating new parkways on nearly every block of the project area. At the August 6th, 2015 community workshop, participants expressed general consensus that a more minimal and less water-intensive landscape program for the parkways was preferred. As a result, the project team is exploring a \u201cno parkway\u201d option, which would not be uncommon for a major boulevard.", "The selection of particular plant species is part of an ongoing discussion with the City\u2019s landscape, urban forest and water resource staff about the need to address historic drought conditions and to devise a replicable model of responsible streetscape design.", "Median Landscaping", "Medians provide an opportunity for additional plant diversity and color due to the likelihood that irrigation can be provided from the City\u2019s water system. The project team believes that median landscaping, particularly at the project\u2019s northern and southern gateways, can add a significant visual benefit and contribute to placemaking. Staff is exploring the addition of trees in the proposed medians, but many of these sites are constrained due to the presence of a sewer main located directly beneath the center lane at depths varying between 6.5-20 feet. Ultimately, the LiNC will establish the preferred type or types of trees to be used along the Boulevard, and staff is actively working with the Urban Forest Task Force Species Subcommittee to determine a planting program.", "Wayfinding", "A citywide wayfinding design effort is underway stimulated by the arrival of Expo Light Rail that will implement an integrated system of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle wayfinding. Concepts for area maps, walking distances and local destinations are being developed right now. The LiNC project will incorporate that wayfinding system into next steps and final recommendations. This may include signage pointing to specific destinations off the Boulevard, and/or area maps for pedestrians to assess their options when on foot. The proposed location of major wayfinding elements are at Ocean Park Boulevard and at Pico Boulevard, where the largest flow of pedestrians have been observed.", "Peak Hour Dedicated Bus Lane", "The Big Blue Bus operates one of its most popular routes (Route #3 and Rapid #3) on Lincoln Boulevard. Combined ridership is approximately 6,000-9,000 daily passengers, with service intervals between 10-20 minutes. Approximately 8-10 buses per direction run on Lincoln Boulevard each hour. Based on Information provided by BBB, buses run behind schedule approximately 40-45 percent of the time, as congested conditions on Lincoln Boulevard cause bus delay of 8-10 minutes.", "Peak period, peak directional bus-only lanes on Lincoln Boulevard have been the subject of consideration in Santa Monica for nearly 10 years. The implementation of peak period bus lanes would improve this situation significantly, and would also provide a financial benefit to Big Blue Bus operating costs, which could then be used to reinvest in new services. Transit Signal Priority (TSP) treatments could further enhance bus speeds by reducing or eliminating delays due to traffic signals.", "The project team has conducted an in-depth study on the benefits of a peak hour dedicated bus lane (see ATTACHMENT E). Staff has also revisited community concerns related to parking impacts.", "Peak Hour, Directional Bus-Only Lanes", "The analysis included in the study revealed that directional peak period bus-only lanes are preferred over all-day bus-only lanes. To maintain a vital business community and streetscape, on-street parking resources must be protected to the maximum extent feasible. Therefore, the proposed design of the peak hour dedicated bus lanes includes conversion of the curbside parking lane during peak periods only, and restriping it to a dimension of 12 feet.", "Travel Time Savings", "During the a.m. and p.m. peak periods, it can take approximately 13-15 minutes or more in a bus to drive from the southern City limit to the I-10 freeway (1.25 miles) and vice versa. The estimated average vehicle travel times (excluding delays due to congestion, traffic signals, driveway and left-turn queueing, and bus stopping for boarding/alighting) are as follows:", "\u00b7 AM Peak period northbound \u2013 14 minutes average vehicle travel time", "Estimated BBB Travel Time in a dedicated lane:", "o Approximately 2 minutes at the posted speed limit of 35 mph, or a savings of approximately 12 minutes.", "o Approximately 4 minutes at the measured average speed of 18 mph, or a savings of approximately 10 minutes.", "\u00b7 PM Peak period southbound \u2013 15 minutes average vehicle travel time", "Estimated BBB Travel Time in a dedicated lane:", "o Approximately 2 minutes at the posted speed limit of 35 mph, or a savings of approximately 13 minutes.", "o Approximately 5 minutes at the measured average speed of 14.4 mph, or a savings of approximately 10 minutes", "If bus-only lanes could be implemented on Lincoln Boulevard from Pico Boulevard to LAX, the savings would be much greater, perhaps up to 25 minutes savings per passenger or more. Coordination with Los Angeles is discussed later in this report.", "Financial Benefits", "The above referenced travel times do not take into account the variability of stopping for loading of passengers, wheelchairs and bicycles. Actual savings on a per trip basis would likely be less. However, even at a conservative estimate of savings four minutes per trip, the impact on passengers would be substantial.  The potential transit travel time savings would also provide a financial benefit to Big Blue Bus operating costs, which could then be used to reinvest in new services. Based on existing hourly costs and a conservative estimated time savings of four minutes per trip, it is projected that bus-only lanes would result in roughly $300,000 savings per year from recouping the lost service hours of buses sitting in traffic.", "Impacts to Parking Resources", "Along Lincoln Boulevard, there are 84 metered parking spaces on the southbound (west) side and 73 on the northbound (east) side. The total amount of utilized parking that would be displaced by a potential bus-only lane would be as follows:", "\u00b7 AM peak northbound [Potential Dedicated Bus Lane] \u2010 10 utilized spaces and 63 available spaces. The parking survey shows that approximately 14% of the total parking spaces are utilized during the a.m. peak hours in the northbound direction.", "\u00b7 PM Peak southbound [Potential Dedicated Bus Lane] \u2010 12 utilized spaces and 72 available spaces. The parking survey shows that approximately 16% of the total parking spaces are utilized during the p.m. peak hours in the southbound direction.", "It appears that in general the level of parking loss could be offset by available parking on the other side of Lincoln Boulevard during the same peak hours, but staff recognizes that providing parking a block away may be an issue for selected business owners. A subsequent outreach effort is underway to address site specific concerns.", "Status of Regional Coordination", "In August 2015, the project team met with representatives from Los Angeles City Council District 11 and LADOT to discuss the potential for regional collaboration. At that meeting, representatives from LADOT shared the City of Santa Monica\u2019s interest in transitioning Lincoln Boulevard to a Transit Enhanced street, and described a number of proposed initiatives currently under consideration for Lincoln Boulevard that were in various stages of development. These ranged from curb-side peak hour dedicated bus lanes, like those proposed in Santa Monica, to a more substantial effort to implement center-running dedicated bus lanes that could later be converted to light rail.", "At the August 6, 2015 workshop, participants reaffirmed their support for peak hour dedicated bus lanes, citing the substantial benefits to the transportation network. Several members of the audience questioned whether dedicated bus lanes should run all day, as opposed to a peak hour schedule, and others asked staff to revisit the ability for bicycles and buses to coexist in a dedicated bus lane facility. In response, staff continues to support only the peak hour bus lane concept, as best practices in urban design and streetscapes imply the need for street parking to support local businesses and to provide a buffer from vehicular traffic for pedestrians. Regarding bicycles and buses, staff will continue to compile case studies from around the region, state and country for a broader discussion with internal stakeholders, as well as review potential legal constraints.", "Ashland Avenue Bicycle Connector (ATTACHMENT F)", "The streetscape elements described above in this report have been designed to improve overall conditions on Lincoln Boulevard with vehicles, transit users and pedestrians in mind, and cyclists have also been considered both within the street design as well as within the larger bicycle network, whose primary connections are directed to Michigan Avenue, Marine Street, Ocean Park Boulevard.", "The project team has spent considerable time evaluating options for robust connector facilities across the off-set intersections of Pearl and Ashland using a variety of guidance from the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations (ASSHTO). A short-term approach for Pearl is described later in this report. With respect to Ashland, a more capital-intensive approach is recommended at this time due to the complexity of circulation functions such as the off-set nature of the street grid connections across Lincoln:", "Ashland Connector", "Two options for bicycle connectors were identified for the Ashland connector.", "\u00b7 Conversion of center turn lane into two-way marked bicycle path. This would be accompanied by a bicycle detection device at Ashland that would allow a cyclist to enter the bike lane in advance of vehicles in order to complete east/west crossings.", "\u00b7 Conversion of center turn lane into an eastbound-only marked bicycle path since the westbound movement is not as challenging with the existing traffic signal. This would be accompanied by the same bicycle detection device, and would be complemented by a raised cement median to separate cyclists from oncoming traffic. West bound movements would use \u201celephant tracks\u201d adjacent to the crosswalk to complete their movement. This option allows for some vegetation enhancement to the median.", "Additional Bicycle Improvements", "Existing bikeways on Michigan Avenue, Marine Avenue and Ocean Park Boulevard are proposed to have enhanced striping for westbound cyclists.The new striping for the proposed bus-only/parking lane will provide additional width between parked cars and the number 1 travel lane since this lane will have a generous 12 foot striping away from the curb. This would provide cyclists who chose to ride on Lincoln with more space, although not in a designated bikeway.", "Property Based Business Assessment District (see ATTACHMENT G)", "A long-term project goal is to assist in the formation of a formal or informal merchant association that supports Lincoln Boulevard businesses through group representation and advocacy. To this end, the project team has held extensive outreach to the Lincoln Boulevard business community and boulevard property owners to provide a forum for local businesses to share their concerns and aspirations for Lincoln Boulevard. Recent meetings have shifted towards the formation of an informal steering committee composed of a group of motivated property and business owners who champion the idea of self-assessment to improve condition on the Boulevard and to exercise control of the outcome.", "A recent survey of Lincoln Boulevard property owners received a 23% response rate, which is above average for an unsolicited opinion. 75% of respondents were \u201cVery Interested\u201d or \u201cInterested\u201d in establishing a Property-Based Business Assessment District (PBAD), and prioritized the implementation of PBAD-sponsored Clean, Safe and Beautiful programs, which help to clean sidewalks and litter, provide information and safety services, and provide landscape planting and maintenance to the district. A PBAD could provide the resources, leadership and long-term vision Lincoln Boulevard needs to enhance its atmosphere and user experience while maintain its organic small-business climate. The time line to establishing a PBAD is from 12-18 months.", "Adaptive Reuse Concept", "One of the project\u2019s goals is to support the existing business environment, and to provide guidance for maturing in place. The project team has also evaluated the ability for existing properties to take on new land uses and new life within the context of Lincoln becoming a neighborhood corridor. This task is particularly relevant due to the challenging development conditions on Lincoln Boulevard, as many properties are shallow and irregularly shaped, and therefore cannot easily accommodate the requirements placed on new development for setbacks, parking, and circulation.", "The intent of the LiNC\u2019s adaptive reuse focus is to demonstrate the range of changes that can be applied to an existing building in order to breathe new life and vitality into it. To provide a real-life example, the project team selected an auto-oriented property on Lincoln Boulevard with the owner\u2019s consent, and created a digital model upon which modifications were made to show how low-cost materials and simple site organization could address neighborhood concerns and create placemaking. Using a phased approach, the Adaptive Reuse Model shows a spectrum of fa\u00e7ade level and building modification applications that result in the subject space being transformed over an incremental period of time.", "The model was developed to be generic and applicable to many other auto-centric, or older buildings along the Boulevard. It intends to inspire property owners by illustrating the relative ease of the transformation, and showcase that often times little more is needed than a coat of paint and thoughtful landscaping. Going forward, the project team hopes to convert the narrative and renderings of the adaptive reuse model into a guidebook for private property owners to pick and choose improvements at their discretion. It is envisioned that the guidebook will include a narrative of how the modifications supports the change in character, provide an associated cost value, and a general outline of the process for engaging the City for permitting purposes. Special attention will be paid to supporting building modifications and fa\u00e7ade improvements that require the least expense and oversight, while creating a high quality public realm. A similar guidebook may be developed for designing the ground floor of new construction projects as well.", "Short-Term Implementation Activities", "These activities are defined as individual or group project elements that take advantage of available resources, are part of existing work programs or City service functions, do not require substantial capital funding, and can be quickly mobilized by both public and private interests for immediate improvement to Lincoln Boulevard\u2019s existing condition. While many of these elements were selected for short-term implementation based on a limited dependency on City funds, some \u2013 like minor fa\u00e7ade improvements on private property \u2013 may be greatly helped by some level of investment from the City.", "New Street Trees", "Infill opportunities for replacement trees currently exist along the Boulevard in as many as 20 locations along the project area.

Once the Species Subcommittee and project team have selected the tree species, work can begin immediately.", "Trash Receptacles", "Trash receptacles are currently only located at BBB bus stops, and users of the boulevard often complain about litter, despite the fact that the City\u2019s Street Maintenance crew routinely collects trash five days a week. Local resident groups have mobilized to address the issue with annual \u201cClean Up\u201d days, which often generate sizeable amounts of waste collected from parkways, bushes and other locations.", "The installation of additional trash receptacles is proposed as a short-term solution to clean up trash and debris from Lincoln Boulevard. Trash receptacles located at an interval no greater than 750 feet (2 blocks) between trash facilities, and could result in more frequent use of the boulevard by pedestrians, particularly if receptacles are located near eating and drinking establishments, businesses selling food and beverages, and crosswalks. The project team has coordinated with the City\u2019s Resource Recovery and Recycling division to locate available supply resources, and can implement the installation of up to 8 trash receptacles immediately.", "Bike Facilities and Amenities", "Bike Racks", "Currently, bike racks do not feature heavily on Lincoln Boulevard due to the nature of the businesses on Lincoln and recent relinquishment of the public right of way. Most investments thus far have focused on the Bicycle Action Plan designated parallel routes on Pearl and Ocean Park. Over the course of public outreach, including discussions with the bicycle community, the project team supports the placement of bike racks at several logical locations within the project area such as near bicycle-oriented businesses such as eating and drinking establishments and stores selling food and beverages, at designated Mobility Hubs (Pico, Ocean Park Blvd), and on sidewalks where bicycle activity has been observed.", "New grant funding to purchase bike racks is anticipated in the near future, which can be directed to the Lincoln Boulevard without a great deal of process, and the project team has already coordinated with the City\u2019s Traffic Engineering and Strategic and Transportation divisions, who collectively oversee bike rack requests and installation throughout the City. Once racks are purchased, the City\u2019s Streets crew can install up to 40 bike racks immediately.", "Pearl Connector", "Pearl has the highest turning movement volumes of any side street along the entire corridor, and therefore no physical intervention, such as a median, is proposed that would interrupt vehicle flow. Instead, the project team proposes the addition of signage and roadway markings to highlight the existing bike network of sharrows on Strand, Kensington and 7th to form a couplet. In this scenario, eastbound cyclist movements would use Kensington and additional \u201cKeep Clear\u201d markings across Lincoln to assist with crossing the Boulevard, while westbound movements would move with traffic across Lincoln to connect with Strand. To facilitate this minor modification to the roadway, the City\u2019s Traffic Engineering staff or a consultant would need to develop striping and signage plans, which could likely be completed with existing resources.", "Side Street Crosswalk Markings", "Crosswalk markings are proposed at 23 side street locations within the project area that are currently unmarked. This effort would include continental striping from curb to curb for distances that are generally no more than 30 feet. While this effort could accompany the construction of larger streetscape elements, like medians and curb-extensions, many of the proposed side-street crosswalks could be implemented in the near term without foreclosing on future construction activities. A minor design effort would need to be undertaken by Traffic Engineering staff or a consultant, and a funding stream would need to be identified, and likely supported by a CIP request. In consultation with the City\u2019s Public Works Department, it appears that at least 1/3 of the proposed side-street crosswalks could be funded by local return Measure R money, as they are within the appropriate radius from an existing bus stop, and therefore qualify for pedestrian enhancement funds.", "Placemaking Activities", "Utility Box Art", "The LiNC Utility Box pilot project is designed to provide Olympic High School students with an outlet to use utility traffic control boxes on Lincoln Blvd. as a canvas for their creative expression. Through coordination with various City departments and Olympics\u2019 Fall 2015 art program, teams of students have the opportunity to design and refine artwork that will be displayed on 7 highly visible traffic signal utility boxes on Lincoln Boulevard between the I-10 Freeway and City Limits at Ozone Avenue. The artwork would be printed on a high-quality, graffiti resistant vinyl sheet, which would be professionally applied in order to protect the boxes\u2019 functional requirements. Student teams are being mentored on the public art process and its execution by experienced local artists from the Beautify Earth collaborative and City staff. Artwork will be temporarily displayed on the utility boxes, potentially for up to a one year period or more.", "The cost for printing the final art pieces onto vinyl is intended to be borne through sponsorship opportunities from local businesses on Lincoln Boulevard, or local neighborhood groups to demonstrate community connections and a coordinated interest in enhancing the visual beauty of the street.", "Curbside Planters", "The proposed curbside planter program has been conceptually designed to complement the efforts of Lincoln Boulevard property and business owners to promote an attractive environment for pedestrian activities, and present an image of a well-maintained district.

The uniform application of color along the project area has the potential to create a distinct district identity for only the cost of paint.", "At the February 23rd workshop, the project team presented the \u201ccolor splash\u201d concept, which garnered a great deal of support from workshop participants ranking higher than many high-value capital improvements such as crosswalks. At the August 6th workshop, the project team provided a series of preliminary photosimulations to show how the treatment might look in a Boulevard environment. A \u201ccolor splash\u201d could also be applied to trash cans or benches, if desired.", "Going forward, the project team believes that one of the first duties of the emerging BID could be to select the color and to commission the project.

Many concerns that have been expressed about Lincoln Boulevard relate to private property maintenance, and the signature lack of investment that characterizes much of this regional roadway facility. An important goal of the LiNC is to support fa\u00e7ade maintenance and public realm improvements, and the project team has explored a number of options ranging from the creation of a fa\u00e7ade enhancement fund, to community-based \u201cclean up\u201d days, to other activities, such as landscaping and steam cleaning, that would ultimately be administered through a Business Improvement District.", "In the absence of any available funding sources for private property enhancements, the team has instead developed a list of over 30 individual fa\u00e7ade projects on properties along Lincoln Boulevard that are low-cost and can be used as guidance to interested property owners.

To motivate property owners to utilize the business improvement concepts and ideas developed through the LiNC project, the project team proposes to develop two programs for Council discussion:", "\u00b7 Lincoln Blvd. Business Improvement Fund: in coordination with the City\u2019s Economic Development division, staff could create a pilot program that supports small fa\u00e7ade improvement projects on private property on Lincoln Boulevard with nominal matching funds, perhaps no higher than $500 per tenant space. Conceptually, Lincoln Boulevard businesses or property owners could apply for matching funds through an application that required 1) design details as required by standard permits, 2) enrollment in the City\u2019s \u201cBuy Local\u201d program, and 3) matching dollars or sweat equity equal to or greater than the City\u2019s maximum contribution.

In coordination with the Current Planning division, staff could draft a Council resolution that, if adopted, could suspend ARB fees for staff-level approvals for a limited time, perhaps up to one year. During that period, staff would actively work with local businesses, code enforcement and other entities to address improvements on a case-by-case basis, gradually enhancing the corridor.", "In combination, the two incentive programs discussed above would likely result in positive changes for Lincoln Boulevard and might create the condition for increased private investment along the corridor such that many of the desired visual and land use outcomes bear fruit in the near term.", "E.

Staff believes that this can be achieved through implementation of a water neutrality ordinance requiring developers to achieve this goal by installing water efficiency retrofits elsewhere in the community; through a modification of the WDM fee; or a combination of both. While many other cities are moving in this direction, there are no \"off the shelf\" models that fully ensure that water efficiency measures eliminate the need for additional water generated by new development. Santa Monica would be breaking new ground; there are practical advantages as well as disadvantages to the various options, including paying for start-up costs for implementation, ranging from $25,000 to $340,000; potential reductions between $235,000 and $300,000 in future Water Fund revenues from WDM fees under the direct offset approach; and possible annual reductions in Capital Facility Fee revenues of between $375,000 and $475,000.", "Background", "On October 28, 2014 during City Council\u2019s discussion of the Water Shortage Response Plan and the Sustainable Water Master Plan, Council directed staff to look into the feasibility of developing requirements to offset or eliminate new water demand related to new development in Santa Monica and report back on what forms those requirements might take. Council also asked staff to look into options for modifying the City\u2019s existing Water Demand Mitigation (WDM) Fee to further incentivize water conservation.", "Water Demand Mitigation Fee", "On February 26, 1991, Council approved an ordinance authorizing the WDM Fee (Ordinance Number 1571 (CCS), codified in SMMC Section 7.16.050). On March 19, 1991 Council adopted Resolution No. 8196 (CCS) setting the fee amount and specifying that it would be used to retrofit water inefficient plumbing fixtures in the City. The intent of the fee was to mitigate the increase in water use of new and substantial remodels in single-family, multi-family and commercial projects during a water shortage. It is a one-time fee charged to new development intended to mitigate the total daily water consumption rate projected for the development. The total daily water demand for the project is calculated using standard water demand factors which were developed by City staff. The fee is set at $3.00 for each gallon of daily water demand which must be mitigated.

These include the cities of Lompoc, Morro Bay, Napa, and St. Helena; San Luis Obispo County; and water districts in Cambria, Monterey and Soquel Creek. In general these policies either require a developer to directly offset the new water demand of their development project through the installation of water efficiency retrofits elsewhere in the community, or pay an in-lieu fee (similar to Santa Monica\u2019s WDM fee) which is used by the city, county or water agency to fund water efficiency offsets.", "Discussion", "Staff from the Office of Sustainability and the Environment (OSE) have reviewed similar ordinances and regulations adopted by other cities, interviewed staff in the cities of Napa, CA and Morro Bay, CA about implementation and effectiveness of their ordinances, and worked with staff from Planning and Community Development, the City Attorney\u2019s Office, Public Works, and the City Manager\u2019s Office to develop the options presented in this report. The City\u2019s Task Force on the Environment and Water Advisory Committee have also provided input on the proposals.

Both of these approaches have positives and negatives and require costs to effectively administer in order to achieve water neutrality. These are discussed below.", "Direct Offset Approach", "Following review of similar water neutrality regulations and discussion with staff in other jurisdictions it was clear that the most effective way to ensure that all water demand related to new development is completely offset is to institute the direct offset requirement. Below is a description of how this approach could be implemented in Santa Monica.", "\u00b7 Applicability: For all projects that require development review permits, development agreements and all projects over a certain size (e.g. 7500 square feet) that require a change-of-use permit (such as tenant improvement projects), any increase in water demand on the project site would have to be offset. In other words, credit would be given for the existing water use baseline on the site, but any additional water demand would need to be offset on a 1:1 basis. This ratio could also be adjusted to require a greater than 1:1 offset in order to generate overall water demand reductions in the event that prolonged drought conditions necessitate a higher offset. Projects in the Paso Robles and Los Osos Water Basins in San Luis Obispo County and within the Soquel Creek Water District are currently required to achieve a 2:1 offset ratio. It is important to note that these areas are currently impacted by either restricted water sources, salt water intrusion, or intensive agricultural uses that are not experienced to the same extent in Santa Monica.", "\u00b7 Calculate Net New Water Demand: The amount of water demand to be offset would be determined during the plan check process either by requiring a developer to submit information regarding the type and number of water fixtures (toilets, sinks, showers, cooling towers, irrigation systems, etc.) in the new development, or by applying a standardized water use calculation based upon the size and use of the building. In both cases, City staff would be required to review the plan submittals and calculate the projected usage from the development. The projected water demand minus the existing water use at the site (determined by taking the average of water use at the site over the previous three years), or, alternatively, an imputed reasonable allocation based upon the existing zoning allowed for development permitted by right, is the amount that the developer would be required to offset. The developer would have an incentive to design the project to be as water efficient as possible in order to reduce the offset requirement.", "\u00b7 Offsets: Eligible offsets would need to be identified in other locations in Santa Monica where water use could permanently be reduced, and then developers would be responsible for implementing those offsets and demonstrating to the City that they have been completed prior to receiving a Certificate of Occupancy. Offsets could include retrofitting toilets in existing buildings, replacing lawns and other high water use landscaping, or upgrading irrigation systems or other infrastructure. Because Santa Monica has a significant amount of older multi-family apartment buildings it is believed that replacing 1.6 gallon per flush toilets with more efficient toilets (1.28 gpf or less), along with efficient faucet fixtures and showerheads, in existing buildings could provide offset opportunities for several years based on the anticipated near term levels of new development and remodels. An offset program could be managed and administered by City staff, by an outside vendor contracted by the City or, as is the case in Morro Bay, CA, a developer could be directly required to identify the offset opportunities, complete the retrofits, and demonstrate to the City that the offsets have been completed. Each of these alternatives, and their associated costs and trade-offs are discussed in more detail below.", "Estimated Volume of Projects", "There are presently 32 projects (26 development agreements and 6 development review permits) that are pending review that could be subject to a water neutrality ordinance requiring direct offsets as described above. Table 1 presents the estimated potential water demand of the pending projects, as analyzed in the 2010 LUCE Final EIR. The total estimated water demand of pending projects equals 695,463 gallons per day, which equates to annual water use of 780 acre-feet per year. The current citywide water demand is approximately 14,000 acre-feet per year so the projected new demand would equate to an increase of about 5.5% beyond current demand. It should be noted that this projected demand does not take into account recently adopted water efficiency standards which would likely result in a smaller increase in water demand than was projected in the LUCE EIR.", "It should also be noted that for development agreement projects, negotiations have typically included performance standards for water efficient fixtures and a minimum percentage below CalGreen baseline for interior and exterior water use, resulting in projects that would likely have lower demand than presented below.", "Table 1: Pending Projects Estimated Water Demand", "Use", "Residential", "Retail", "Office", "Hotel", "Cultural", "Hospital", "Amount", "1,802 units", "402,988 sf", "106,800 sf", "921 rooms", "13,700 sf", "799,000 sf", "Estimated Water Demand Factors*", "124 gpd/unit", "0.15 gpd/sf", "0.10 gpd/sf", "130 gpd/room", "0.11 gpd/sf", "0.35 gpd/sf", "Estimated Water Demand (gpd)", "223,448", "60,448", "10,680", "119,730", "1,507", "279,650", "*From 2010 LUCE Final EIR", "Sample Offset Calculation and Cost for Compliance", "In order to determine a rough estimate of the potential cost to developers to fully offset their water demand, staff evaluated a small sample of newly built mixed-use and multi-family properties to determine their actual water usage. These water use figures were compared to the previous water use at each site to determine the amount that would be required to be offset in order to achieve water neutrality for that property. The cost of the offset was determined by calculating the average water savings for the replacement of an existing toilet with a more water efficient model and then dividing the amount of water to be offset by the amount of savings per toilet to determine the number of toilets that would need to be replaced in order to meet the offset requirement. Toilet replacement was used for this estimate because it is the most cost effective way to reduce water usage and would likely be the method chosen by most developers to offset new water demand.", "The buildings evaluated for this estimate had between 36 and 122 individual residential units. The annual water use in the buildings sampled averaged about two million gallons per year with the per unit water usage averaging about 32,500 gallons per year.", "Based on a current contract with a plumbing company to install high-efficiency toilets, the cost to replace an existing residential type toilet is approximately $350. There would also be a cost for administration which would be determined based on the projected number of new projects, plan review, verification, certification, and database management.

This represents a typical project constructed in the downtown area in the past several years. It is important to note that the potential water offset requirement for any project is highly variable depending on the previous water usage on the property.", "Sample Offset Calculation and Cost - Mixed Use Building with 40 Residential Units", "Previous Water Use at Site", "(Gallons Per Year)", "Proposed Water Use of New Development (Gallons Per Year)", "Water Use in Gallons to be Offset Per Year", "Number of Toilets to be Retrofitted", "Cost to Retrofit Toilet (doesn\u2019t include admin fee)", "34,229", "1,300,000", "1,265,771", "1,084", "$379,400", "Proposed New Development: 40 residential units", "Average Water Use per Unit: 32,500 gallons/year", "Proposed Annual Water Use (entire project): 32,500 x 40 units = 1,300,000 gallons/year", "New Water Demand to be Offset: 1,300,000 (new development demand) - 34,229 (existing water use at site) = 1,265,771 gallons/year", "Average Water Savings for each 1.6 gallon per flush (gpf) toilet replaced with a 1.28 gpf toilet: 3.2 gallons per day x 365 days = 1,168 gallons", "Number of Toilet Replacements Required:", "1,265,771/1,168 = 1,084 Toilets", "Estimated Cost:", "1,084 toilets x $350 (cost to retrofit a residential style tank toilet) = $379,400 to offset 1,265,771 gallons per year", "Based on the above example (and other estimates calculated but not shown here) and factoring in estimated administrative fees, it is anticipated that the cost to a developer to offset 1000 gallons per year of new water demand would be approximately $350 - $500 if the retrofit were accomplished through the replacement of toilets. As noted above, there are many variables that have been used to arrive at this rough estimate and it is only provided to help with discussion.", "Implementation and Costs for Direct Offset Options", "1. City Administered Program \u2013 This option would be entirely administered by the City of Santa Monica\u2019s Office of Sustainability and the Environment. Staff would identify existing properties throughout the city whose owners are interested and willing to have their plumbing fixtures upgraded with more efficient fixtures to offset the additional estimated water use of applicable new development or improvement commercial projects; approve applicable project offset requirements; hire and assign plumbers to install the devices; and track the installations and water offsets.  The developer/applicant would pay the City directly for all expenses related to the offset process. This option would require the hiring of one full time staff person. Ongoing annual costs (including staff salary costs) would be approximately $150,000. In addition, first year program start-up costs would be approximately $115,000 for a new staff work station and office equipment, computer software upgrades, and miscellaneous expenses. Alternately, if this option were completed using existing staff, the start-up and ongoing staffing costs would be avoided, however, OSE\u2019s ability to provide water consultations to residents and businesses and effective enforcement of water efficiency regulations would be reduced. This would negatively impact OSE\u2019s drought response efforts and would make it more difficult to achieve the City\u2019s water conservation goals. A City administered program would allow for accurate tracking and verification of achievement of water neutrality goals but is also the most staff intensive and costly.", "2. Applicant Administered Program \u2013 For this program, the City\u2019s involvement would be minimal. The developer/applicant would be required to identify offset options in the community, negotiate with the property owner where the offsets would be obtained, complete installation of the offset equipment using their own installer, and pay all costs. OSE staff would oversee the verification process with costs for verification able to be recovered through the collection of a permitting and processing fee paid by the developer/applicant. This option would not likely require the hiring of additional staff however if the volume of offset applications is significant this would impact the ability of existing staff to complete other job responsibilities, including water consultations to residents and businesses and effective enforcement of water efficiency regulations, in a timely manner. One-time costs would likely be approximately $25,000 for computer software upgrades and ongoing costs for computer maintenance would be approximately $5000 per year. This option would shift the burden for compliance to the developer, and could become onerous for small development projects to complete.", "3. Vendor Administered Program \u2013 this option would be similar to option 1 except that the City would hire a vendor to administer all aspects of the program. Staff estimates that the annual cost to complete this scope of work would be approximately $150,000 for an outside vendor, with an additional $25,000 for first year start-up costs.", "Options 1 and 3 above would provide the best quality control and tracking of water offsets but would require significant start-up costs to administer. It is anticipated that costs could be recovered through permitting and processing fees, however funds would need to be identified in order to initiate the program. In addition, all options would likely result in a net loss to the City due to a decrease in Water Fund revenues.", "Implementation of a water neutrality requirement for new development could also result in the reduction in development-related revenues that currently accrue to the Water Fund. New developments are currently required to pay connection fees and capital facility fees to the City in order to connect to the City\u2019s water system. Accrual of these fees based on anticipated future development in Santa Monica was factored into the calculation of the City\u2019s current water rates. Capital facility fees generate approximately $375,000 to $475,000 per year in revenue depending upon the level of development from year to year. The capital facility fees are charged to help offset increased capacity requirements to the water infrastructure that the project will create. If a developer offsets the water demand from a new project, it would be difficult to calculate and charge a capital facility fee for that project. However, while the total water demand in the City would be unaffected, the new development would still be increasing the water demand within its localized area, with a concurrent decrease in the area where the offsets were installed. This localized increase in demand could require localized infrastructure upgrades which would require a new source of funding. An alternative fee mechanism to account for these anticipated costs would need to be developed in order to adequately fund future infrastructure and capacity upgrades.", "Timeline for Direct Offset Program Development and Launch", "Staff estimates that a City- or vendor-administered direct offset program could be established and ready for implementation within 11 months.

It is a one-time fee charged to new development to mitigate the total daily water consumption rate projected for the development, and applies to new development and major remodels of single family, multi-family and non-residential projects. The fee generates approximately $300,000 per year and is used to fund City water efficiency infrastructure upgrades, including replacement of irrigation systems in parks and public landscapes, rainwater catchment and reuse systems, and installation of water efficient fixtures in public facilities.  The fee amount was developed in 1991 and is based on the estimated cost to offset a gallon of water demand at that time. For single family and multi-family residential projects, the fee is based on estimated water use for a typical project of each type. For non-residential projects the projected water use is estimated based on the project square footage and building type.", "Staff was not able to identify any jurisdiction that is effectively using an in-lieu fee option to offset 100% of projected water demand from new development projects. The primary reason for this is that these fees are often times generated by many small projects in small amounts and, because jurisdictions typically use the fees to fund infrastructure projects which are often large and expensive, these improvements may happen months or years after a development is completed. Staff was unable to find a jurisdiction that carefully tracks water savings from projects funded by water demand mitigation or in-lieu fees and links them back to the projects that generated the funds. This is not to suggest that in-lieu fees are not effective at producing water savings, but rather that it is difficult to directly track those water savings back to a specific development to demonstrate that the new demand from that development was completely offset.", "The WDM fee could be used on its own or in conjunction with a Direct Offset program to address water neutrality in new developments and major redevelopments. If used on its own the WDM fee would continue to apply to all development projects. If a Direct Offset option is preferred by Council, for smaller projects that would not require development review or change of use permits, such as single family residential and very small commercial and multi-family projects, Council could require that those projects pay the WDM fee to ensure that new water demand is indirectly offset for those projects as well. Alternately, Council could exempt these small projects from paying the fee. Because of their small size these projects generate relatively little new water demand. Collectively they currently generate approximately 22% of the WDM fee revenues however they represent 76% of the projects that are subject to the fee.", "If Council directs staff to pursue either of these options, staff recommends that the WDM Fee be reevaluated and updated to reflect current costs to offset water use and more accurately reflect projected water demand from new projects. This process would require a new nexus study, further fee analysis and Council action if the amount of the fee were increased. A tracking procedure could also be established to provide better correlation between the water savings achieved by the projects funded by the fee and the increased water demand generated by the projects that paid the fee. The estimated costs and trade-offs for these various approaches are discussed below.", "Implementation and Costs for In-Lieu/WDM Fee Options", "If Council wishes to continue using the WDM Fee, either as the sole means to address and offset new water demand, or in conjunction with a Direct Offset program, staff recommends that a fee analysis and nexus study be completed.

After the meter expired, they removed the items and vacated the parking spaces. The image of the temporary park was shared extensively through social media, and Rebar received requests to create their project in other cities.

The consulting team and the City\u2019s Building Official identified the need for further testing and developed preliminary estimates of both the anticipated costs of such tests as well as the likely cost of repair, which ranged from $227,372 to $423,172. Initial test results of the sculpture showed inconclusive results for the fiberglass shell and some rust and corrosion of the internal steel frame.

However, research into the matter revealed that, while very few safety training firms have the ability to satisfy the City\u2019s unique commercial vehicle and heavy equipment safety training needs like Trukspect, a healthy pool of firms are available to supply general safety training services. Therefore, staff recommends the City pursue a two-phased approach for satisfying the safety training needs identified in the RFP: 1) enter into a five-year agreement with Trukspect, Inc. for a total amount not to exceed $180,600 for the commercial vehicle and specialty heavy equipment safety training component of the RFP only, and 2) issue a new RFP for the remaining general safety training components of the RFP.

Staff did not recommend this work to occur concurrently with the California Incline Project for a couple of reasons. The California Incline is funded with Federal Transportation funds with an 11% local match and would have required multiple coordination and authorizations through Caltrans because the POC would be fully paid by the City thus mixing project accounting and further delaying construction of the Incline. There was a lot of public concern about the length of closure of the Incline and the traffic impacts resulting from this closure, so adding project work at that time would have met stiff opposition. The designer T.Y. Lin and staff have worked to expedite the design after the initial traffic impacts of the closure were not realized.

Practical limitations exist in attempting to place more than six meters at a new MFR project, given the space restrictions in alleys and street parkways. The existing code contains an exemption to this requirement for affordable housing projects. Given the water conservation benefits of individual metering, via submetering, for all residential units including low income units, this report recommends amending SMMC Section 7.12.150 to clarify that MFR projects with more than six units be required to install a City master meter with private submeters, and that the exemption for affordable housing projects be removed.  To offset the cost impacts of eliminating the exemption from separate metering for affordable housing projects, staff recommends reduced water rates for MFR units in 100% dedicated affordable housing projects.", "Background", "SMMC Section 7.12.150 requires individual water meters for each unit of new multi-family residential construction. It includes an exemption for affordable housing projects, allowing the developer to provide a single master meter for the project if an acceptable alternative method for determining water consumption for each unit is provided. Although the staff report introducing Ordinance No. 1513 (CCS) at the February 13, 1990 (attachment C) Council meeting addressed the issue from the perspective of construction costs, the prevailing consideration at the time was a prolonged drought affecting California from 1987\u20131992. It was assumed that individual metering would enable residents and the City to monitor water consumption and reinforce water conservation measures in place at the time.", "However, as a practical and legal matter, implementation of the requirement is a challenge for many multi-family residential developments. To allow for periodic reading and maintenance, SMMC Section 7.12.140 (e) requires that water meters be placed within the public right-of-way on the street side of the development or in an alley behind the project. The frontage area of many properties along the street often is not large enough to accommodate multiple meters, and alleys behind many properties similarly present space constraints due to their narrow width and conflicts with other utility services in the alley. As a practical matter, the two code sections conflict. Multi-family projects incorporating more than six units require significant space for meters which is often not available because of placement of parkway trees, refuse enclosures, or parking areas among other things. Consequently, projects other than affordable housing developments have installed master meters rather than individual meters, with the condition that submeters be installed as a means of monitoring individual water consumption and continuing the focus on water conservation. This requirement is enforced by Public Works staff in Water Resources as a condition of development or during plan check by staff in the Civil Engineering Division.", "Submeters are individual meters behind the master meter. These meters are installed on each water line servicing the individual units, allowing the monitoring of water consumption for each unit. Whereas the master meter is City-owned and maintained, submeters are owned, operated, and maintained by the landlord, property management firm, condominium association, or homeowners association.  A representative listing of multi-family residential projects, which have been required to install submeters in recent years, is included in attachment D. For illustrative purposes, attachment E is a photograph of a submeter installation for an 8-unit project at 1837 12th Street.", "Also, plumbing systems in new multi-family construction utilize central water heaters for the entire building, thereby providing energy savings for the building as opposed to having multiple water heaters. As a result, each unit is supplied with separate cold and hot water service lines. In some cases developers have installed dual submeters in individual units, but the technology for hot water meters is relatively new. Therefore, the more common practice has been to provide cold water meters only for individual units.", "As an alternate methodology to submeters, some landlords in multi-family developments in Santa Monica have utilized the Ratio Utility Billing System, or RUBS.

This estimate was provided by Community Corporation representatives. As a potential offset to this cost increase, staff recommends reduced water rates for multi-family residential units in 100% affordable housing projects. Similar to the low-income program currently provided for single-family customers, the discount would be $1 per HCF of water in the first tier for each unit in an affordable housing project.", "In the current rate structure, multi-family customers receive 4 HCF of water in the first tier for each residential unit.

The fare analysis conducted indicates that BBB\u2019s current pricing structure does not conform to industry norms (with some products priced above the peer average and some below). Findings include that the average one-way fare in the region is $1.25, most day passes are priced at 2.5 to 4 times the base fare; and the average 30-day pass is 45.26 times the base fare.", "In instances where BBB pricing has been higher than the peer average, the result has been soft sales of those fare products. For example, at $60, the current 30-day pass is 60 times the base fare, which is well above the peer average of 45.26 times the base fare. Therefore, it is not seen as a good value by riders, many of whom ride one round trip each weekday, averaging about 40 to 45 rides per month. Although many riders use BBB services every weekday of the month, only 2% of riders currently use a monthly pass. The proposed fare structure lowers the regular 30-day pass price to $50, or 40 times the base fare of $1.25, providing a strong incentive for regular riders to purchase the product instead of using cash, thereby speeding travel time, and reducing operating costs as a result.", "These findings and the detailed fare restructure proposal were presented at the public hearing held on September 10.

Cash customers require an average of 23 seconds of dwell time to complete payment, while a prepaid boarding customer using a magnetic stripe card or smartcard requires less than 4 seconds to complete payment. This significant difference in boarding speed of cash customers produces a drag on system efficiency, as all passengers must wait for each transaction to complete before the bus can move forward. Increasing the number of customers using prepaid fares through discounting of passes enhances the attractiveness of transit, while simultaneously lowering the cost of operating the routes.", "As of the end of FY 2014-15, as shown below, 3% of customers used 30-day passes, 2% used 13-ride passes, 3% used day passes, and 1% used tokens.

In that light, it is likely that more students are using a youth 30-day pass than are using a 13-ride passes when looking at the whole universe of sales.", "When viewing only sales through schools, a clearer picture of the relationship between the products is revealed. BBB had three school customers in FY 2014-15 and together they purchased $19,016 worth of the two fare products in question. Of that total cost, 13-ride passes accounted for only $2,616 in total sales, while 30-day youth passes accounted for $16,400 in total sales. BBB sold six times as many 30-day youth passes to schools as 13-ride passes. Stated another way, the 13-ride passes made up only 13.7% of the non-disability fares purchased by schools. Regarding the suggestion that BBB should match the LA Metro youth fare in terms of a single ride price, the proposed pricing of the 13-ride pass at $14 makes the cost of one ride $1.08, which is near to the $1 fare offered by LA Metro for students.", "BBB favors encouraging use of the 30-day youth pass over the 13-ride pass, as the option of the 13-ride pass for students inadvertently encourages the practice of parents driving students to school in the morning, and the students using transit only one way, to get home. While this practice is commonplace, it creates significant congestion around the schools as numerous parents approach nearly simultaneously to drop students off. The discounting of the monthly pass encourages higher overall transit utilization as all rides for the month are paid for up front. This by nature encourages parents to put students on the bus for both directions of the trip, reducing congestion around schools in the morning and creating a safer environment. While certain parents may still want to drive their students one way to school, the fare structure will not encourage this practice by making it cheaper to do so. In light of this analysis, BBB does not recommend changes to what is proposed in terms of student fares.", "Five members of the public advocated consideration of varying distribution channels to support BBB goals of faster boarding time and ease of use. The goal is to increase the number of retail locations that sell BBB fare media and TAP cards with the option to load and reload value. Currently, retail locations in Santa Monica selling BBB fare products include BBB\u2019s Transit Store, the libraries in Santa Monica, Vons grocery store on Wilshire Blvd. and Ralphs grocery store on Cloverfield Blvd. TAP cards are available for sale at all ticket vending machines at Metro rail stations, the Transit Store and the Vons and Ralphs stores.

This site is perceived by many as the gateway to the distinctive places that make Santa Monica unique. This intersection marks the western entrance from the Interstate 10, access to the Pier and beach under the landmarked Pier sign, and the southern edge of Santa Monica Promenade and Santa Monica Place shopping districts. People seeking these destinations and the adjacent Tongva and Palisades Parks pass through this intersection on foot, bikes, buses, in cars, and in less than a year, via train.", "The history of planning this intersection spans a decade. In 2005, the Council approved a Civic Center Specific Plan that included the station site and a new Olympic Drive to expand the Downtown/Civic Center circulation network (completed 2014). In 2006, the City acquired the properties located at 1632-36 5th Street and 402 Colorado Avenue. At the time of purchase, the terminus station of a future light rail line was considered for this site. With light rail now in place, the site is a key location in Santa Monica.", "The station currently occupies approximately 34,000 square feet of the site.The remainder City-owned portion (approximately 86,250 square feet) and the adjacent properties, have constrained access because the station occupies the former access to Colorado Avenue. Because of the complex circulation infrastructure at this junction (an interstate freeway, a bridge, light rail, city streets, and sidewalks), careful consideration and planning is now in progress to optimize integration of future transit-oriented uses on the site, such as office, retail, and commercial businesses; parking; affordable housing; and/or other public uses. Community outreach identified a desire for creating a place of arrival and departure that honors the Santa Monica identity while also providing long-term improvements to the City\u2019s transportation infrastructure.", "The importance of the long-term vision is highlighted in the Draft Downtown Specific Plan (DSP), currently underway, which defines specific parameters for the use and design of the 4th Street and Colorado Avenue intersection and 4CO site. The first stage of visioning for this site addressed provision of an interim use concept for the City-owned property to support transit transfer and multi-modal first/last mile connections in time for Expo light rail operation. The interim use concept, approved by Council on February 24, 2015, improves the upper lot for pick-up and drop-off while the lower lot is under construction. Once the lower lot is completed, the upper lot would remain as a potential swing space if temporary events were held in the lower lot. Both lots can be easily reconfigured as the demand for private shuttles, paratransit, and kiss-and-ride becomes more evident. The upper lot will be completed in time for Expo\u2019s anticipated Spring 2016 opening, and the lower lot will follow several months later.", "Following approval of the interim use, Council directed staff to proceed with the strategic planning and long-term use analysis of the site, including definition of circulation and access, land use, urban design, and economic feasibility parameters. Concepts proposed in the Draft DSP have been included in the ongoing site analysis, including relocating the 4th Street freeway off-ramp and coordinating the freeway-adjacent properties with the 4CO site to achieve network expansion and multi-modal circulation improvements at this prominent gateway.", "One approach for comprehensive examination of the unique access and site configuration challenges of these freeway-adjacent properties is the creation of a \u201cGateway Access Master Plan\u201d that further refines the circulation vision that the Draft DSP presents for these sites. As currently envisioned, the freeway-adjacent properties made up of the 4CO, Sears, Wyndham Hotel, and Big Blue Bus sites would be included in a master plan area.

Benefits of a coordinated design include opportunities for shared parking, better access to all sites, and connectivity between the site and surrounding areas. Long-term use analysis will define objectives and parameters for a potential joint-use partnership.", "Background", "City Council meetings regarding the Exposition Light Rail Project in Santa Monica began in 2007. On May 11, 2009, Council allocated a portion of redevelopment funds to study the feasibility of bridge connections and freeway capping to integrate the Expo Light Rail terminus station, Civic Center, and Downtown. On January 19, 2010, Council directed staff to explore refining the Civic Center and Downtown circulation network as described in the then draft 2010 LUCE. Options for reconfiguring the 4th Street off-ramp were explored to disperse automobile traffic west and away from the key intersections adjacent to the Expo station in order to improve pedestrian quality and station access and ensure safety for all network users. A new freeway off-ramp aligned with Olympic Drive was recommended for consideration, and termed the Olympic Crossover (See Attachment A). On April 12, 2011, Council prioritized short- and long-term projects related to the Civic Center and Downtown circulation network. On September 13, 2011, Council received an update on the refined alignment of the terminus station which resulted in a smaller station footprint, creating the larger remnant site at 4CO. On January 24, 2012, Council approved planning for first/last mile access to the terminus station, including further exploration of freeway off-ramp location and bridging concepts. The work was put on hold in 2012 due to uncertainties of continuing to use redevelopment agency funding for the analysis. After significant community input, the Council approved the Colorado Esplanade on July 10, 2012. This project exemplifies integrated multi-modal station access. Using the roadway changes required by the light rail, the Esplanade project creates space for pedestrians, a protected bike facility, and streamlined vehicle flows and continues the one-way westbound direction to Ocean Avenue to simplify the number of turning movements and provide more fluid throughput at the 4th and Colorado intersection. The project is currently under construction and, when completed, will fully integrate multiple travel modes to guide users to key destinations. The 4CO site should carry the exceptional design and placemaking attributes of the Esplanade to the whole station area, making circulation legible, efficient, and safe for everyone.", "On June 10, 2014, Council authorized a third contract modification for AECOM to provide planning, urban design, infrastructure, transportation, environmental, and economic consultant services for the 4CO site. The 4th/Colorado Station Site Studies Project (4CO Project) was initiated to develop both an interim use that addresses transit interface when the train first becomes operational, and to provide long-term analysis and visioning for the remaining 4th/Colorado property. On November 25, 2014, Council reviewed the interim use concept design for the 4CO site and directed staff to expand stakeholder outreach and generate a revised interim use concept design. On February 24, 2015, Council approved an interim use that provides temporary multi-modal connectivity and access not included in the Expo station design (See Attachment B). Council also directed staff to focus on the long-term use analysis of the station site to determine options for the highest and best use of the site. Approval of the interim use concept does not eliminate or restrict any particular long-term use option.", "On October 13, 2015, staff recommended to Council the creation of a \u201cGateway Access Master Plan\u201d focused on the freeway-adjacent sites that create the key gateway to the Downtown, and based on the overall principles in the Draft DSP. Council directed staff to proceed with the creation of a Gateway Access Master Plan process that would holistically plan for the 4CO, Sears, Wyndham Hotel, and BBB sites. Council also commented that the master plan should include the study of access and circulation issues (i.e. as it relates to property access and the 4th/Colorado intersection) and the exploration of freeway capping opportunities as open space opportunities.", "Discussion", "Currently, the 4th/Colorado crossroad is at the heart of several important projects that are under construction: the Colorado Esplanade, new cinemas at Santa Monica Place, and a temporary use for the terminus station site. Additional streetscape and wayfinding projects are in design for 4th Street both north and south of the 4CO site and future renovations to the Civic Center Auditorium will rely on the smooth functioning of this area. The long-term use for this crossroad must consider both the importance of an iconic gateway and the critical transportation infrastructure that serves the commercial and social center of the City.", "On August 5, 2015, staff presented draft long-term use objectives and potential site scenarios for the 4CO site to the Planning Commission for review and comment. The Planning Commissioners commented on key elements of the project, providing input for the ongoing work effort.

The PC recommended inclusion of an objective that addresses bicyclist circulation, including the need for bike parking and access to and from the site.", "Community Benefits and Urban Design Approach: The large-scale community benefits of the Olympic Crossover off-ramp realignment provide open space and circulation improvements to the Downtown network, and collectively received widespread PC support. With regards to the Olympic Crossover, the PC remarked that ensuring a comfortable pedestrian crossing and repurposing Olympic Boulevard and Palm Court should be priority components of this effort. The Commissioners noted that 4th Street should become a more pleasant environment for pedestrians and bicyclists to facilitate multi-modal access to the train, and the project should include wider sidewalks and/or minimize curb cuts. The concept of on-site shuttles and kiss-and-ride areas, a new street/paseo, and a parking structure accessed directly from the freeway were recognized as valuable components; however, Commissioners also wanted the site to de-emphasize vehicles and more strongly support placemaking and pedestrian amenities. Commissioners advised that the appropriate bus facility options for this site include minimizing or excluding on-site bus operations and continuing to explore bus connections with on-street alternatives and/or use of the existing Big Blue Bus (BBB) facility. Commissioners discussed the urban design and circulation challenges and barriers constraining on-site bus operations.", "Potential Land Uses: The PC stressed the need for open space that is flexible and programmable, and spoke to the importance of considering revenue-generating uses such as office and hotel to support BBB operations. The PC noted that this site was the most suitable place in the downtown to address the high demand for new office spaces. Due to the adjacency to light rail, office uses at this site would allow for a high AVR employee workforce, resulting in fewer vehicle trips. Some Planning Commissioners also requested the consideration of fine-grained retail to activate the space during the day and night, and to consider affordable housing that is not directly adjacent to the freeway. The Commission agreed that a bus facility was not the preferred use, noting the desire for buses to use the existing street grid. However, they supported the concept of potential BBB revenue through consideration of revenue-generating office use at this site. Commissioners had differing opinions about open space and housing as top priorities but all agreed that entertainment should not be a main focus. Commissioners wanted the uses and urban design to focus on function and transition, particularly at the ground floor, to create an engaging, active, and beautiful space.", "Potential Alternatives: The majority of the Commission would like to proceed with a comprehensive approach that assumes change on the whole site, including the City-owned property, Comma Building property, 4th Street off-ramp and embankment, and Palm Court (approx. 146,350 square feet). In this comprehensive approach, Commissioners felt that multiple architects designing the site would be beneficial and ensure that the final design represents a variety and range. One Commissioner felt that the site could be designed using one designer or multiple designers, in relation to a phased approach or in one grand process, and that staff should provide an RFP process that allows for some flexibility in the type of proposal.", "The 4CO site is a critical component of the Downtown and the linchpin for the Downtown/Civic Center circulation.

INITIAL DRAFT SITE OBJECTIVES", "The Expo station will be the arrival and departure point for many people in Downtown Santa Monica. As a City-owned site at a critical location, it is essential that the 4CO site satisfy community priorities. 4CO should define the Santa Monica experience with the same level of investment that the City has made in the Esplanade and station area. New land uses should be considered within the surrounding context to complement the station area as well as maximize the benefit of transit adjacency.", "Based on the community and stakeholder input for the Expo Light Rail, Esplanade, Draft DSP, and interim use planning processes, staff has developed broad draft objectives for the Council to consider. These objectives provide an initial lens through which to evaluate the technical analysis, consultant direction and proposal for a joint-use partner for the future of the site.", "a. Prioritize circulation improvements. The community continues to express that circulation and traffic are their highest priority. As a crossroads for multiple types of transportation, this site is a unique opportunity to address circulation improvements. These divide into two sub-categories:", "b. Prioritize a place for people. As the transition area between circulation modalities for visitors and residents alike, and a gateway for all, the urban design should celebrate the location with spaces for people to interact and enjoy. The site has clear views toward the ocean above the freeway, allowing for orientation and the experience of Santa Monica\u2019s unique ocean air and light. The site will be a focal point and a crossroad, as well as the place where many newcomers will have first sight of this environment. As Santa Monica continues to be at the forefront of 21st Century sustainability practices, the site should celebrate the ideals of sustainability and environmental stewardship that define the City. 4CO provides a unique opportunity to ensure that people arriving at this major portal to the City, regardless of mode of transportation, feel they are not at the end of a trip, but beginning their Santa Monica experience.", "c. Consider land use in relation to circulation. Decisions about land use will impact the circulation in and around the site, having far reaching influence on the city-wide circulation network. This site provides a unique opportunity for transit-oriented design, allowing residents or employees to access the site without the use of a car. The mix of land uses can be calibrated to take advantage of shared parking, transit adjacency, and location in the City\u2019s vibrant Downtown to provide an active environment while mitigating traffic impacts. The City has long sought to use transit-oriented strategies that combine employment centers and housing that accommodate both high Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR) and low trip generating transit-dependent office, and housing, as well as hospitality and supporting retail uses. The large sites adjacent to the freeway have complex edge conditions due to the topography and location of the freeway. Considering these sites together will allow for significant access improvements for each of these sites.", "d. Providing revenue support for BBB operations. Because a portion of this site was originally purchased with transit funds, staff anticipates that a significant portion of potential revenue will be allocated to BBB operations. The key community benefits identified to date are circulation-oriented, large Capital Improvement Projects that benefit City circulation as a whole. Balanced land use planning will be critical to maintain an economically viable vision for the site. To this end, ongoing economic analysis and evaluating multiple site scenarios are a key component of the immediate work effort. Ongoing analysis will provide the necessary information to allow decision makers and the community to focus on achieving a joint-use partnership that realizes the community\u2019s transportation and urban design goals. Because the size of an on-site bus facility significantly affects site configuration and opportunities for other uses, as well as financial feasibility, staff requests Council feedback on whether a bus facility is a low- or high-priority and, if a high-priority, which bus facility scenarios should be analyzed. If a bus facility is not considered an option for this site, then revenue-generating uses should be prioritized to meet the objective of supporting BBB operations.", "3.

Initial analysis shows that this improves level of service at 4th and Colorado, which is currently one of the busiest intersections in the City. The Olympic Crossover would also enable a signalized intersection at 4th Street and the new street/paseo. Without the Crossover, the signal spacing between the existing off-ramp and Colorado Avenue would be too short. A signalized intersection at 4th Street and the new paseo would improve access to kiss-and-ride and site access on the constrained freeway-adjacent sites. Based on the placement of the new street/paseo per the approved interim use plan and assuming the construction of the Olympic Crossover, new signalized intersections at 4th Street could be located at one of these locations:", "o 4th/Olympic Crossover and 4th/New Street-Paseo, or", "o 4th/Olympic Crossover and 4th/Existing 4th Street off-ramp (right-in and right-out at 4th/New Street/Paseo)", "Additional network analysis of the potential signalized intersections at 4th and 5th Streets will be performed to determine the specific impacts and allowable turning movements for the long-term, based on use-specific trip generation.", "Bus Operations (D on key): Long-term analysis of the site should consider the optimal number of on-site bus bays with the appropriate access and necessary space for turning movements.

This would require coordination and collaboration among the property owners to create agreements for through-circulation.", "Caltrans Process (B and C on key): City staff and Caltrans have begun discussions about the appropriate process to evaluate the technical requirements for proceeding with the 4th Street curb cut and the Olympic Crossover. The 4th Street curb cut and the Olympic Crossover could be processed together or separately. As the Crossover project requires significant analysis and evaluation, the City is currently submitting paperwork to initiate that process. The City will request to initiate the analysis and documentation required by Caltrans by completing a Project Study Report\u2013Project Development Support Project Initiation Document (PSR-PDS PID). The PSR-PDS PID process is anticipated to take a minimum of 8 months, and will be followed by subsequent environmental, final engineering, and construction documentation processes.", "Land Use", "In consultation with AECOM economic staff, an initial look at potential land uses suggests that most uses, except for extensive retail, appear to be viable options for the site. With the potential west and south-west views from the site, a new hotel may be a fitting use for the site. Easy access to regional transit system would alleviate vehicle demand for hotel and office uses. When compared to other uses such as residential housing, Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures have proven most effective and easier to monitor when applied to office uses. The best choice of use mix should include consideration of circulation capacity, station proximity, shared parking opportunities, and pedestrian activity. If a permanent bus structure is not included in the permanent long-term vision, construction costs for the Olympic Crossover and parking will likely be significant factors in determining the financial feasibility of the overall project. While affordable housing as a use was not explicitly listed as a possible community benefit in the Draft DSP due to proximity to the freeway, discussions following the release of the Draft Plan consider that housing, with a component of affordable housing, should be studied for suitability as a land use for this site. Hotel, residential, office and limited retail are all uses that would meet current and future demands in the downtown.", "Parking", "As depicted, utilizing the entire site could produce approximately 350 parking spaces per level. This number will be considerably less for prototypes that assume a smaller land area (i.e. City-owned area only). It should be noted that should the project be constructed in phases \u2013 with the City-owned properties being the first to come online, the parking structure could be built in phases and, if appropriate, designed to connect to the Sears site through the existing access tunnel. Several factors will also dictate how much parking can and should be accommodated on site such as: land use mix, pricing and parking feasibility, ingress/egress access points, intersection absorption, and DSP parking strategy goals.", "4. SITE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS \u2013 BUS FACILITY INVESTIGATION", "Big Blue Bus recently completed a comprehensive rerouting of transit connections to incorporate all Expo Station sites. The first part of the service changes occurred in the summer of 2015 with the balance of Expo-related changes to occur in February 2016. The interim 4CO use includes on-street bus stops on 4th and 5th Streets coordinated with BBB rerouting. Like the interim use process, the long-term analysis also considers options for intermodal transit interface. Determining the level of bus facility at the site is critical to understanding the feasibility of all land use and circulation scenarios. A variety of possibilities were analyzed to evaluate the tradeoffs between a significant bus facility and potential revenue-generating uses with the understanding that the ultimate long-term use should support BBB either with additional facilities or revenue. Due to large bus turning radii and size of vehicles, bus facilities require significant site footprint, maneuvering spaces, and station areas. Ramping to upper or lower levels must accommodate bus vertical and horizontal clearances as well as wide ramp radii. As a result, bus facility drives the opportunity and constraints of the long-term vision. BBB is currently weighing the benefit of having bus access onsite versus a financing source that would subsidize future operations.", "Staff has worked with consultants and interdepartmental partners to explore concepts for bus operations located onsite. Some options were considered for discussion and determined to be infeasible due to the topography of the site and other site constraints, but are discussed here to allow Council to fully understand the challenges of the site. The following scenarios were developed to fully understand the trade-offs of accommodating buses onsite and are illustrated in Attachment E.", "A. Subterranean Facility Concept", "A subterranean concept was discussed and discarded by staff. The facility would require +/-24 feet of height at a subterranean level (this includes thicker structural materials for the long-span clearances needed for subterranean bus maneuvering). Significant excavation would be needed to depress the bus facility on the sloping site. The necessary continuous ramping to maneuver buses underground while \u201cchasing the grade\u201d would constrain any other uses on the site, make parking design difficult, and increase headway time for buses as they have complex on-site circulation. This concept would also require bus riders coming from the train to walk underground to transfer.", "B. Stand-Alone Facility Concept", "A stand-alone bus facility concept would entail a bus facility located approximately at grade with 4th Street (partially below 5th Street) and would allow up to six bus berths. This concept assumes the bus facility to be open-air with no uses above or parking below. A sloped roadway would connect 4th and 5th Streets. While this configuration would allow direct interface between train riders and bus riders, it would significantly reduce potential for pedestrian-oriented placemaking and opportunities for other transit-focused uses. Buses would require less on-site circulation than a grade-separated facility, saving some space for layovers.", "C. Construction Above Bus Facility Concept", "This concept would utilize the bus facility layout of the prior option with up to six bus berths designed so the ground level accommodates bus staging and movements, while the upper levels house other uses. Like the prior option, it requires a large portion of the useable site at the ground level (approximately 38,000 square feet). Because a bus facility would necessitate floor to ceiling height of +/- 24 feet, access to upper level uses would be complex, limiting ground floor pedestrian interest and potentially affecting value. Access to underground parking would have to be coordinated with bus access points, limiting parking potential.", "D. Station Platform Grade Facility Concept", "This concept proposes a bus facility at the level of the station platform (elevated from 4th Street). This configuration could accommodate up to eight buses with access from 5th Street and a potential new connection to 4th Street at the south end of the site.Buses would be highly visible and easily accessible for riders exiting the train, but would likely require a stairway and related ADA accommodation for riders accessing buses from 4th Street.Design of a pedestrian frontage on 4th Street would be challenging due to grade changes. This is the only concept that assumes the Paseo to be located at the southern portion of the City-owned area. The Paseo could accommodate taxi and shuttle services, but would have reduced potential for programming that activates the edge of the new street, and would likely require closing of the 4th Street tunnel. A building could be considered over the bus facility, but would incur additional costs due to longer structural spans required over the bus facility, and with challenging urban design issues on the 4th Street property edge.", "E. On Street + Paseo Concept", "This alternative provides a paseo/street through the center of the site\u2014which is wide enough to accommodate up to four bus berths or shuttle and kiss-and-ride\u2014 and anticipates, if needed, an additional bus berth on the west side of 4th Street that could be negotiated as part of a future Sears site upgrades. Bus pick-up/drop-off will be located closest to the station and highly visible for riders exiting the train. A signalized Paseo connection to 4th Street enables flexible and direct bus routing and site access to the east and west. This scenario provides most consolidated efficient use of land and opportunity to design an inviting pedestrian frontage on the paseo. Contiguous land space is likely to create greater value to fund ongoing BBB operations.", "F. On Street Concept", "This concept would utilize the future bus stops along 4th and 5th Streets that are being constructed as part of the interim plan. It assumes all bus movements and boarding/alighting would take place along the streets, with buses and cars being able to utilize the street/paseo for connections between 4th and 5th Streets. If needed, an additional bus berth on the west side of 4th Street could be negotiated as part of a future Sears site upgrades. This concept would require wayfinding to help users to locate buses further away. This concept supports flexible use of land and better connections to the southern portion of the site. This configuration is anticipated to generate more land value than other concepts. The Planning Commission comments supported this scenario.", "The above scenarios provide the comparative analysis to allow decision-makers to understand the benefits and drawbacks to varying levels of investment, circulation, and site configuration. Attachment E includes greater detail on the technical specifics for each of the above scenarios.", "5. ALTERNATIVES DEVELOPMENT", "The most recent step in the site analysis has been to synthesize the information presented in this staff report, and develop a series of conceptual site scenarios for the purposes of illustrating options and approaches to site planning. None of the conceptual scenarios are intended as proposed prototypes, but are useful to stimulate discussion of priorities and options.Each conceptual scenario mixes options for land area, site configuration, building footprint type (office, residential, etc.), access locations, and urban design. Each scenario also includes some elements of network access and circulation improvements outlined in the Draft DSP. The scenarios include different options for improving the City-owned site separately or in concert with the adjacent private parcel. Other options evaluate a mix of different land areas and assumptions to understand the benefits and tradeoffs of providing an on-site bus facility or other land uses, such asa residential-oriented project. Feedback on these conceptual scenarios will help to identify prototypes for the next step of understanding an optimal land use mix, economic feasibility, and potential to finance the large-scale community benefits of ongoing BBB operations, shared parking, and the Olympic Crossover.", "Building Footprint Assumptions", "In order for development on this site to fit within and contribute to the downtown, the following urban design principles are being considered in future investigation:", "\u00b7 The design should complement the pedestrian-oriented, eclectic Downtown Santa Monica context.", "\u00b7 The site should accommodate a variety of public and private open spaces with varying sizes.", "\u00b7 The ground level plazas and spaces between buildings should promote pedestrian activity and interest.", "\u00b7 Buildings should provide visual interest both up-close and from a distance, through variety of massing and skyline variety.", "The following diagrams indicate how building footprints could be set depending on land area assumed and the potential implications on circulation, land use, urban design, and economic viability.", "Diagram A", "Diagram A illustrates changes to the 4th/Colorado City-owned property (approx. 86,250 total square feet), which includes the Apple Building site. Planning for the site is simplified and potential outcomes of this scenario are manageable to a greater extent since it utilizes only City-owned property. However, this trade-off for increased certainty may limit larger objectives, such as off-ramp re-location.", "Diagram A illustrates access and circulation from 4th Street that is separate from 5th Street, where 4th Street accommodates motorists exiting the I-10 Freeway and parking and 5th Street accommodates pick-up and drop-off. The two buildings shown would have off-set first floors of 1-2 levels, with the west building level with 4th Street, and the east building elevated over the pick-up and drop-off area. Pedestrians can connect east-west through the site via a staircase. Vehicles that enter/exit from 4th and 5th Streets could connect below grade in a parking level. Circulation improvements gained from 4th Street and 5th Street access, whether connected through a street/paseo or not, are possible in this scenario.", "Potential Implications to Objectives:", "\u00b7 Circulation: Benefits that could be gained from the construction of the Olympic Crossover, including signalizing a new 4th Street intersection, achieving through access between 4th and 5th Streets, and considering ingress/egress to the northern and southern portions of the site, are not captured in this scenario. While the pedestrian realm along 5th Street could be moderately improved, Palm Court would need to remain as access to the existing southern office building and most likely for all kiss-and-ride and shuttle drop-off and pick-up activities, precluding any significant improvement for the eastside of the property. The tunnel connection to the Sears site remains in this scenario and could be used as part of a future circulation strategy.", "\u00b7 Land Use: Building footprint dimensions and locations, away and buffered from the freeway, support and appeal to light retail and hotel on the ground floor, and hotel, office, and/or housing above. Parking would likely be limited to the City-owned land, barring efficiencies that could be gained through a phased development with the southern property.", "\u00b7 Urban Design: Because of the topography of the site and building elevations, the northern and western portion of the 4th Street building would be programmed with walk-up uses and the 5th Street building would have challenging urban design that would make activating any ground floor areas with pedestrian-oriented uses difficult. The east-west orientation of the buildings means that valued views would almost exclusively be enjoyed by the 4th Street building and limited for the eastern structure. The most useable space for people to gather would be directly adjacent to the station platform stairs.", "\u00b7 Economic Feasibility: This scenario assumes the smallest assembly of land area and therefore lower construction cost, but also the least potential for providing community benefits and achieving City priorities. Elevating the eastern building over the drop-off area would increase some construction costs. Without inclusion of a bus facility and the Olympic Crossover, shared parking would be the most monetarily intensive community benefit of the property.", "Diagram B", "Diagram B builds on a modified Diagram A and presents an illustration that assumes the full site in phases and lowers the eastern building to ground level. Phase 1 includes the 4th/Colorado City-owned property (approx. 86,250 total square feet) and Phase 2 includes the Comma Building property and the 4th Street off-ramp and embankment (approx. 43,800 square feet).

The new street will help to break down the block, enforcing the Downtown District\u2019s grid; potentially accommodate kiss-and-ride and shuttle drop-off and pick-up activities; and provide access to the Phase 1 uses with another potential access point anticipated from the existing off-ramp once Phase 2 is complete. With this approach, Palm Court would need to remain for accessing the existing southern office building in Phase 1 and any reconfiguration of Palm Court would need to occur in Phase 2, potentially limiting optimal access and circulation benefits. The tunnel connection to the Sears site remains in this scenario and could be used as part of a future circulation strategy.", "\u00b7 Land Use: This scenario presents greater potential for underground parking by gaining efficiencies in the footprint of parking levels and creating Phase 2 access potential at the southern end of the property. Buildings buffered from the freeway support active frontages along the Paseo and 4th Street and appeal to light retail and hotel on the ground floor, and hotel, office, and/or housing above. Buildings adjacent to the freeway offer ocean views, the most direct access to/from the 10 freeway, and appeal to shared parking, hotel, and office.", "\u00b7 Urban Design: Lowering of the building on 5th Street to grade level significantly improves the urban design frontages. In this scenario, the pedestrian experience can be improved along the entire edges of 4th and 5th Streets in Phase 1 and the site\u2019s southern edge in Phase 2, making it possible to activate all four sides of the site. This configuration pushes buildings to the south, allowing for pockets of open space to be introduced, tying the three buildings together while increasing site permeability. Attention to design and activation of the road and plaza area will be needed to ensure a safe and comfortable space south of the station.", "\u00b7 Economic Feasibility: While this scenario assumes a greater assembly of land area, necessitating higher construction costs, efficiencies gained through the fixed costs of constructing the Paseo and ramping to the subterranean structure should translate into higher revenue generation compared to Diagram A.

The new street will help to connect 4th and 5th Streets; break down the block, enforcing the Downtown District\u2019s grid; and accommodate access through the site and to the subterranean structure, which would be accessible by all buildings. By introducing new access points, Palm Court could be recaptured and redesigned to circulate vehicles around the southern end of the site and allow for an additional access point to the garage. In this scenario, kiss-and-ride and shuttle drop-off and pick-up could be accommodated on the new Paseo and/or the reconfigured Palm Court.

A comprehensive planning effort would allow all buildings to be designed in a way that makes sense for the anticipated use rather than limiting design and use of space based on existing lot lines.", "\u00b7 Urban Design: Designed and constructed as one development, this scenario presents the greatest flexibility for multiple designers and diversity on the site, making the most efficient use of the project area, connecting all uses at the site, and resolving complex topography issues. The layout optimizes new pedestrian connections and significant gathering places through comprehensive urban design improvements, including a sizeable plaza adjacent to the station site. This configuration makes it possible to activate all edges of the station area site, including a stronger connection to the Expo station and providing some screening of the TPSS site.", "\u00b7 Economic Feasibility: Diagram C provides cost savings by minimizing phasing and the construction time. By assuming all of the land areas develop together, efficiencies realized through fixed costs of constructing the Paseo and ramping to the subterranean structure, coupled with the potential utilization of Palm Court and the area adjacent to the freeway, should translate into higher revenue generation compared to other concepts.

The water budget required by the State is now even more complicated than the previous MWELO, which was difficult for applicants to understand and comply with.", "The City\u2019s current code requires that an applicant submit a water budget as part of their plan submittal for landscaping. In spite of specific instructions being provided to applicants regarding calculation of the water budget, nearly all landscape plans currently submitted have an incorrect water budget. This requires staff to devote significant additional time explaining how to calculate the water budget and tends to delay projects. Using the proposed prescriptive measures would allow designers flexibility to create beautiful, sustainable, and water-efficient landscapes without burdensome calculations that slow the plan check process.", "Adopting the MWELO\u2019s list of licensed and certified professionals allowed to submit plans broadens the number of knowledgeable professionals that provide design services in Santa Monica. Requiring the same types of landscape plans for all new development projects provides consistency and streamlines the plan check process. Currently single-family projects do not have to submit a full set of plans if they are only installing the minimum requirement of two inches of mulch. The proposed change would require single-family projects to submit landscape plans.", "Currently, the majority of single-family projects make a note on the plan set that only two inches of mulch will be installed. Staff approves these plans, because they meet current code. Following approval, however, mulch is often replaced with high-water plants, turf and inefficient sprinklers not compliant with code. Staff performing the inspection prior to issuance of a certificate occupancy, which allows the homeowner to move into their home, must stop the project; require a landscape plan; and require the necessary changes to bring the landscaping into compliance. The homeowner then hires someone to create and submit a set of plans, which delays the project and creates an unexpected expense at the very end of the project. If a landscape plan is initially required, the project would be completed sooner and at less expense. For developers that sell the home immediately after finishing the project and homeowners that may not be able to afford to install the landscape, they would still be able to install mulch without any other plant material or irrigation in order to get a certificate of occupancy. However, they would have an approved landscape design that could be installed at a later time.", "Banning sprinklers and turf in certain projects would eliminate runoff and reduce water use a minimum of 30% below MWELO requirements. The majority of landscape plans submitted during the past two years have included sub-surface drip irrigation for all plants including turf, shrubs, and trees, so this new requirement is not expected to present difficulties for future applicants. Limiting the high and moderate water use plants in Residential new developments would allow these landscapes to have hedges, lawns, shrubs, and trees, which is the most common landscape designs for single-family and multi-family properties.", "The MWELO requires soil criteria and testing at the end of the project. Staff is recommending adopting this without any changes.", "Requiring the addition of master valves and flow sensors would ensure that the irrigation system is designed to work as a unit and will shut-off the irrigation system when a leak is detected thus saving water immediately. The majority of commercial and single-family landscape plans submitted during the past two years currently include these so this new requirement is not expected to present difficulties for future applicants.", "Staff is recommending adopting the MWELO irrigation meter requirements for single family projects and requiring dedicated irrigation meters for all multi-family and commercial projects.", "Proposed Solar Requirement", "The California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen) is the state building code that sets minimum requirements for the design, construction and operation of new buildings to reduce negative environmental impacts. The City adopts CALGreen when the State updates it. The minimum energy efficiency requirements of CALGreen reference what is required by the State Energy Code. On a triennial basis, CALGreen and the Energy Code are updated to require greater levels of energy efficiency in new buildings. This process is driven by the State\u2019s goal to achieve zero net energy (ZNE) for new construction in the residential sector by 2020 and in the commercial sector by 2030.", "In 2011, the previous building code adoption cycle, Council adopted the Santa Monica Green Building Ordinance, which required a 15% energy efficiency improvement (also known as reach code) beyond the then-current (2010) Energy Code. Additionally, a solar ready requirement was included to ensure Santa Monica buildings were designed to optimize the potential for solar photovoltaic energy generation. The current (2013) Energy Code takes precedence over the City\u2019s existing (2011) 15% energy efficiency requirement, therefore rendering it obsolete. Local amendments to the State Energy Code requires 1) the Council to expressly find that such changes or modifications are reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological or topographical conditions; and 2) the California Energy Commission (CEC) to approve the amendment by making the finding that the proposed amendment is cost-effective. To date, staff has been unable to demonstrate that a more stringent energy requirement would be cost-effective for the community based on the 2013 Energy Code. Therefore, staff is proposing that Council repeal these obsolete provisions.", "Renewable energy is not required in CALGreen or the Energy Code, but is considered essential to achieving the State\u2019s ZNE targets. Proposed changes to the State Green Building Code would require a solar energy system to be installed in all new residential construction projects based on building size or estimated energy usage, and in multi-family and commercial projects based on building footprint size. Staff has reviewed the attached California Energy Commission Cost-Effectiveness Study (Attachment M) for solar energy systems and agrees with the conclusions of this study that solar energy in Climate Zone 6 (where Santa Monica is located) is a cost-effective investment. If the Council approves this modification to the State Green Building Code, staff will expeditiously bring these changes to the California Energy Commission for its review and approval. If the Energy Commission approves, staff will return to Council for second reading of this ordinance.", "Increasing temperatures, severe drought and wildfires in California have increased the sense of urgency to take action on climate change by reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Governor Jerry Brown issued a set of sweeping goals (Table 1 \u2013 Attachment N) to dramatically influence California\u2019s building stock in the next 15 years. Similarly, Santa Monica has ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. In order to achieve these targets and significantly avoid harmful greenhouse gas emissions, the City must advance aggressive policies and programs designed at achieving deep reductions and maximum reach. Adopting renewable energy requirements has been specifically identified in various City policy documents as one of the City\u2019s strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Table 2 \u2013 Attachment N) and enhance energy independence. Codifying the direction and intent of these documents into a consistent requirement will allow the City to encourage the deployment of renewable energy citywide, especially in areas not covered by development agreements or specific area plans.", "The proposed Ordinance would effectively eliminate the existing Solar-Ready Ordinance as the solar requirement would obviate the need for adequate roof space in order to comply.

Both cities utilize a prescriptive requirement that ties the solar system size to the size of the building or the lot, respectively. The City of Sebastopol, a small low-growth city, cited a challenge in achieving 2 watts/square foot in the commercial sector and waived the requirement in lieu of installation of energy efficient equipment. The City of Lancaster, a fast-growing suburban community, established a watt/square foot requirement based on lot size, which is relatively low. Apartment buildings are required to provide 0.5 kW of solar per unit, but to date, no new apartment buildings have been built since the mandate. It is yet to be determined if interconnection will be for the common area loads or unit\u2019s loads. Proposed solar requirements for apartments is discussed below.", "For the residential sector, staff opted to provide options for compliance without mandating oversized solar systems by offering a prescriptive path with respect to available roof space or a performance path that accounted for the building\u2019s estimated energy needs. This would incentivize energy efficiency so that smaller systems could comply. Alternatively, a third path is offered for energy efficient homes that would save as much energy as a solar system would produce on that same building.", "Staff conducted research on recent installations in Santa Monica to determine the applicability of the size and energy to be offset by the proposed requirements (Table 3 \u2013 Attachment N) and found that the majority of installations complied and exceeded the proposed Ordinance requirements.", "In the non-residential sector, staff conducted research on existing and new commercial buildings that feature solar photovoltaic systems that were either voluntarily installed or required via Development Agreement. Additionally, staff experimented with use-case scenarios to develop an ambitious but achievable target for solar. With two watts per square foot of the building footprint as a base requirement, a building with a 10,000 square foot building footprint would require on average less than 15% of the available roof space to meet the requirement (Table 4 \u2013 Attachment N) which is less than the 30% allotment of the Solar Ready Ordinance. This would allow for additional and alternate uses of the building's rooftop while providing a significant amount of renewable energy for the building. Staff believes this requirement is minimal but is routinely exceeded in practice. An alternate compliance path for offsetting a percentage of the building's energy load for non-residential buildings was not offered due to the complexity and variability of buildings, ownership and leasing models.", "The cost of solar has decreased significantly over recent years, making it an attractive investment. Additionally, financing mechanisms like solar leases and property assessed clean energy (PACE) have made solar even more accessible. The study conducted for the CEC confirmed that solar is a cost-effective measure for buildings, paying for itself over the life of the system and is therefore a reasonable measure to mandate.", "Solar for Multi-Tenant Buildings", "Staff designed the capacity requirements for non-residential buildings with awareness of what is commonly known to as the split-incentive. The split-incentive refers to the situation where the building owner pays for the installation of solar energy systems but cannot realize the return on investment if the system produces more energy than what the owner is responsible for. This is usually called the common-area load. In multi-family buildings, individual apartment dwellers have sub-meters and pay their utility bill directly to the energy provider. The same is the case for tenants of a commercial office building. Currently, in the absence of clear and sufficient mechanisms to share renewable energy, building owners of multi-tenant buildings typically install solar systems that are estimated to generate as much renewable energy as what will be the common-area load. At two watts per square foot of the building footprint, it is staff\u2019s determination that the renewable energy produced will generally be similar to the common-area load based on the size and types of non-residential construction Santa Monica expects to see in the near future.", "Although clear and established mechanisms for sharing renewable energy between building owners and tenants are not currently available, there are reasons to believe this will change soon. Virtual net-metering (NEM-V) allows for the energy generated by a single solar system to be credited to multiple accounts on the property. However, complications, in terms of financing, payback, cost-sharing, technical feasibility and utility ambivalence on the subject, make it a burden for the property owner to invest in and manage. The NEM-V interconnection process (setting up a meter and then pre-determining load allocations) is complicated, at best, making it prohibitive to provide solar for tenants.", "Staff are currently seeking to address this issue through a pilot research project with the Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a San Diego-based non-profit. CSE will provide training and resources to local solar contractors to equip them so that they can support a NEM-V project. The City and EcoMotion will identify Santa Monica properties that are interested in solar and seek to address the challenges and barriers. CSE\u2019s research will help inform the delivery model necessary to providing solar widespread for the multifamily sector. Additionally, staff are exploring other partnerships with businesses who specialize in solar for the multifamily sector.", "EcoMotion prepared the attached Consultant Study of Solar Mandate Impact (Attachment O) to augment staff\u2019s research for the development of the solar requirement.", "Pools", "Staff will bring to Council at a later date recommendations for making pools more water-efficient and energy-efficient.

By establishing two-year terms for task force members, current/new members can commit to a  defined term instead of an unknown period, and staff can work around upcoming vacancies instead of rearranging meetings due to unexpected resignations. Members wishing to extend their service would be allowed to serve an indefinite number of two-year terms lasting until a task force's objective is complete. The current policy prohibiting double membership only applies to City boards and commissions, boards of non-profits and regional advisory boards. By limiting Council-appointed members to serve in no more than one advisory group at a time, membership to the City's 24 groups can be opened up to other citizens who may bring fresh perspectives and ideas, and the rule would be applied to more Council-appointed members. Should a member's expertise be needed by more than one board/commission, Council may make an exception, with a super majority vote. The exception for the Building & Fire-Life Safety Commission would remain, because of the Commission's infrequent meeting schedule.", "Staff recommends that the Council set two-year terms and no terms limits for task force members; prohibit double membership for all Council-appointed members, except for members of the Building & Fire-Life Safety Commissions; and allow any members currently serving on more than one group to complete their terms. Should the Council disagree with staff recommendation, no service terms would be set for established task forces; future task forces may set terms as they are created; and members of task forces and committees may continue to serve on more than one advisory group.", "Other minor changes to the resolution consist of: updating the resolution with names of newly formed boards, commissions, task force and committees; deleting references to boards that no longer exist; incorporating established term limits for certain groups; revising the City Clerk\u2019s procedures on reviewing minutes and providing regular attendance records, and clarifying the procedure for a board or commission to request to remove members for non-attendance to meetings. The update for the City Clerk to provide attendance reports from twice to once a year reflects current practice when reports are provided to Council during the Annual Appointments process. The update to change the review of agendas and minutes from bi-annual to biennial also reflects current practice as all agendas submitted to the City Clerk\u2019s Office for posting are reviewed prior to posting and minutes are reviewed biennially with the goal to achieve uniformity in content and format with the Council\u2019s minutes.", "Rules of Order and Procedure for the Conduct of City Council Meetings", "At the January 14, 2014 Council meeting, Council amended the Rules of Order and Procedure for the Conduct of Meetings to allow the public to donate an additional two minutes of their speaking time to a designated speaker. After implementing the new rule for over a year, staff encountered instances when requests to donate time were submitted late and/or requests to donate time were submitted for Public Input, and the current rules did not provide sufficient direction on how to proceed. At a recent Council meeting, a request to donate time was submitted late and the Council approved to hear the speakers, but the designated speaker was given all four minutes whereas late and single speakers are generally given one minute as a penalty. There also have been several occasions when a member of the public donates time to another speaker for general Public Input and takes advantage of the time donation rule by raising subject matters that have previously been addressed by Council or that are not within the Council\u2019s jurisdiction.", "Staff considers the maximum time limit of two minutes to be sufficient for the public to address the Council on matters not listed on the agenda as the Council can always exercise their power to give the speaker additional time to finish comments or answer follow-up questions, or agendize the item for further discussion and public comment at a future meeting. Additionally, members of the public are always welcome to contact the Council on matters pertaining to the City outside of a meeting by mail, email, telephone or in person. Therefore, staff recommends that the Council revise the rules denying all late requests to donate time and all requests to donate time for general Public Input. Should the Council disagree with the recommendations, staff would continue current practice and accept late requests to donate time for one minute only and requests to donate time for Public Input.", "The second revision that staff recommends is to add a rule that the Council disclose off-record contacts relating to quasi-judicial matters before voting on the matter. This change would help ensure fairness and a complete record.", "Other updates to the resolution are: changing the delivery date of the meeting packet from the Wednesday before a Council meeting to Tuesday, revising the physical agenda posting location of agendas from the Clerk\u2019s Office to the City Hall Lobby, revising the list of Categories and Order of Business by deleting Inspiration and revising Special Ceremonial Agenda Items (Agenda item 2) to include brief updates from the City Manager, and adding new boards and task forces to those that may report under Reports of Boards & Commissions (Agenda Item 10).", "Santa Monica Municipal Code, Chapter 11.04 Elections", "Disclosure Requirements During Signature Gathering Period for Referenda", "At the July 10, 2001 Council meeting, staff proposed two methods ensuring the integrity of the initiative process and one method was to adopt new regulation relating to financial disclosure. At the July 24, 2001 Council meeting, Council added section 11.04.165 creating additional disclosure filing requirements for committees supporting and opposing ballot measures as the Political Reform Act only requires semi-annual or quarterly reporting. It was also during this time when the Council first considered electronic filing of campaign disclosure statements.", "On January 7, 2015, the City Clerk\u2019s Office received the attached 12-Item form (Attachment 4) requesting to place an item on the City Council agenda to amend section 11.04.165(c) by revising the last two filing deadlines for committees raising or spending funds to support or oppose a referendum and adding a fourth filing deadline.

The 24th day would fall on Fridays but if Council is concerned with the deadline falling on an alternate Friday when the City Clerk\u2019s Office is closed, then it was suggested to change the deadline to the 23rd day. The author also proposed to shorten the third filing period from 60 days after the end of the gathering period to 7 days so that disclosure statements are available to the Council and voters at an earlier time and that the deadline will fall on Thursdays when the City Clerk\u2019s Office is open. The last proposal was to add a new filing requirement to record financial activity after the 30 day gathering period.", "A summary of the proposed changes are listed in the chart below:", "Number of Filing Periods", "Days of Filing Period", "Filing Deadlines", "1", "1-5", "10th day of period", "2", "6-20", "25th 24th or 23rdday of period", "3", "21-30", "60th 7th day after end of period", "4", "Day after end of period+14 days", "No later than 1 week before the public hearing", "Staff finds the proposals reasonable and recommends that the Council amend section 11.04.165(c) to change the second filing deadline to the 24th day, the third deadline to seven days after the end of the 30 day gathering period, and create a fourth filing deadline covering 14 days after the 30 day period and setting the deadline to 19 days after the end of the gathering period, or five days later, and regardless of when petitions are submitted. Although the second filing deadline may fall on a closed-Friday, filers may meet this deadline by filing early or filing electronically if the Council mandates e-filing of campaign statements.", "Electronic Filing of Campaign Disclosure Statements", "At the June 19, 2007 Council meeting, Council authorized staff to purchase NetFile, an electronic filing system for campaign disclosure statements, to improve the City\u2019s electoral process. On January 1, 2013, Government Code Section 84615 went into effect allowing local government agencies to require elected officers, candidates, committees and other persons required to file campaign statements and other documents to file online or electronically with a local filing officer. Since 2013, over 20 California cities, including Berkeley, San Francisco, Sacramento, Santa Barbara, and Pasadena have passed paperless filing ordinances. On September 30, 2015, Assembly Bill 594 was passed to amend the Political Reform Act and revise the definition of \u201ccommittee\u201d by increasing the qualifying monetary threshold to $2,000 for contributions received by a person or combination of persons.", "Prior to using NetFile, City Clerk staff posted scanned portable document formats (PDFs) of typed or handwritten campaign disclosure statements online making them free and available to the public. As the number of candidates and issues vary per election, the number of campaign committees varies as well. However, the majority of campaign committees use the electronic filing system and file electronically while the rest file printed or handwritten hard copies with the Clerk\u2019s Office. One reason that a number of committees do not file electronically is that committees are still required to file hard copies with candidates and treasurer\u2019s wet signatures under the current law, despite filing online. The only way to make hard copy statements available on the website is for Clerk staff to continue to post PDFs.", "Other reasons why committees do not file electronically are: a preference for paper forms over other software or NetFile; little to no financial activity; and, although difficult to prove, to reduce transparency. Although the City\u2019s filing system assists with filing and posting statements online, permitting a combination of filing methods allows candidates and committees to provide different levels of transparency. For example, the average voter could spend a longer time searching for particular contributors or expenditures through handwritten or typed statements that went through the optical character recognition (OCR) process than they would with an electronically filed statement. Also, handwritten or typed statements would not easily retain and track information from previous statements such as multiple donations from a contributor who may reach the City\u2019s contribution limit. In addition, current law does not prohibit committees from filing electronically for one period and then filing a paper copy for the next period which may cause information to be harder to track.", "Advantages to electronic filing for the candidate, treasurer, and proponents/opponents for measures, are that: access is free online so that candidates do not have to incur costs for accounting software and services; information from most accounting software is compatible with the system; information from previous statements are retained, saving time on filing new statements; the software helps reduce data entry errors; and statements are automatically posted online. For the voters advantages include: copies of statements can be downloaded free of charge; information can be exported to spreadsheet software or the City\u2019s new Open Data Program for analysis; and statements are immediately available during evenings and weekend and do not require waiting for Clerk staff to upload statements by the next business day. Advantages to mandatory e-filing are that: deadlines can be met if they fall on closed Fridays; only one statements needs to be filed preventing two different versions from being mistakenly filed by paper and electronically; and paper, time and postage would be saved by filing electronically as opposed to hard copies.", "The NetFile system meets the requirements of GC Section 84615 by accepting filings in a standardize record format developed by the Secretary of State; ensures the integrity of data transmitted, including safeguards to alter data; redacts confidential information such as addresses; sends filers electronic confirmations that statements were received, with the date and time, and a copy of the statement; permits electronic signatures on statements; provides data to the public in an easily understood format; and allows the Clerk to maintain information for at least 10 years. GC 84615 also exempts smaller campaigns that do not raise $2,000 or more or spend $1,000 or more from filing electronically and may continue to file paper statements. To prevent any hardship, the Clerk's Office offers a public computer for NetFile, will provide training, and implement e-filing on January 1, 2016, to allow time for information to be disseminated and filers to have sufficient trainings. This would make the January \u2013 June 2016 semi-annual statements the first statements to be filed electronically.", "Transparency and helping voters make informed decisions were the original goals of purchasing the electronic filing system. Limiting the filing method to one method and using the full functionality of the software would bring all candidates, committees and proponents/opponents of measures up to a level playing field and move the City closer to transparency goals. Therefore, staff recommends that Council amend the election code regarding disclosure requirements for referendums as proposed by the originator of the 12-Item Form, and mandate electronic filing of campaign disclosure statements. Should Council disagree with mandatory e-filing, staff recommends approving recommendations from the 12-Item Form and set the second filing deadline to the 23rd day of the period so that all deadlines fall on a business day. Alternatives to this recommendation are to maintain the current filing schedule and practice of accepting non-electronic and electronic campaign statements.", "Acceptance of Petitions and Samples", "At the April 10, 1990 meeting Council directed staff to prepare an ordinance requiring the City to provide sample formats for initiative petitions that would help clarify legal requirements that must be met in preparing a petition for an initiative, referendum or amendment to the City Charter. At the February 4, 1992 meeting Council adopted an ordinance adding exhibits of initiative petitions to the election code and charging the City Clerk to review petitions prior to circulation and upon the request of circulators. Current law requires the City Clerk to review the petitions within seven days, and if the Clerk fails to reject the petitions during this time, then the format is presumed to be in compliance. The intent of the law was apparently to streamline the petition process.", "Experience indicates that the City Clerk review does not streamline the process. Moreover this section appears to create potential liability to the City as the City Clerk may be viewed as not impartial to the process. The City of Berkeley provided sample petitions in its Municipal Code, but does not require staff to review as to form. The City of Beverly Hills reviews petitions but does not advise proponents on how to correct petitions. Most California benchmark cities surveyed follow the State\u2019s Election Code, which is silent on the topic, and advise proponents to secure an elections attorney (see Attachment E). Therefore staff recommends that the Council delete sections 11.04.170 Acceptance of Petition and Exhibits to Chapter 11.04 of the City\u2019s Elections Code to reflect State Code.", "Additional Amendments", "Other proposed changes to the election code consist of: 1) amending section 11.04.010 Nomination of Candidates for the City Clerk to collect the filing fee at the time of filing nomination papers rather than the time of issuing; and 2) amending section 11.04.090 Family Contributions to include contributions from same-sex spouses as separate and not aggregated contributions. Staff recommends amending these sections to reflect the State Election Code and account for same-sex marriages.", "Financial Impacts & Budget Actions", "There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended actions. Funds for NetFile software maintenance in the amount of $10,000 are included in the FY 2015-16 Adopted Budget in the Records and Election Services Department at account 01212.555010.

Approximately $1.5 million of the increase is anticipated to be on-going, including a greater than anticipated revenue increase in property taxes, sales taxes, licenses/permits and fines, offset by a lower than anticipated increase in transient occupancy tax and utility user tax revenue. The remaining $7.2 million of the increase is from one-time sources that will be used to support one-time costs. These include greater than anticipated revenues in charges for services, documentary transfer tax and reimbursements from other government agencies.", "Including the adjustments in this report, General Fund net expenditure savings were $3.7million, or 1.1%, below budget. This amount includes $6.5 million from operating expenditure savings, offset primarily by the appropriation of one-third of savings back to the departments as part of the expenditure control budgeting program. Over 79% of Department savings was due to approximately 105 vacant positions throughout the year.

Include provisions in Santa Monica Airport (\"the Airport\" or \"SMO\") leases that limit the sale of aircraft fuels for piston-engine aircraft to low-lead or unleaded fuels and fuels for turbine-engine aircraft to biofuels or other sustainable fuels by a date or dates certain; 2. Include provisions in flight schools leases prohibiting lessees from using leaded fuels for flight training; 3.

Assess and report back to Council on the possible termination of third party fuel sales at the Airport and on the feasibility of the City taking over that function to assure that, so long as aircraft fuel is sold at the Airport, it is the most environmentally sound fuel available; and 5. Begin developing and report back on a cap on total emissions generated by the Airport.", "Body": ["Executive Summary", "A growing body of scientific evidence establishes that lead emissions from piston aircraft engines and black carbon and other emissions from turbine aircraft engines are detrimental to human health and to the environment. This is a world-wide challenge and a significant local problem. Studies performed at and around the Airport in recent years document the extent of the harmful emissions generated by its operations. In light of these scientific and technical studies and of Airport neighbors' first-hand reports about the impact of emissions on their lives, the City Council directed staff to return with a report providing alternatives for reducing aircraft emissions. This report responds to that direction.", "It provides information about aircraft emissions and efforts to reduce them; and it discusses alternatives for reducing emissions locally, including alternatives suggested by members of the community. The report discusses and recommends using lease provisions to limit fuel sales at the Airport to cleaner fuels and to require flight schools to switch to unleaded or low-lead fuels. Staff's recommendations also include requiring the businesses that sell fuel at the Airport to begin remediation of any contamination on their premises now and assessing the possible termination of third-party fuel sales and the assumption of such sales by the City, for whatever time period fuel continues to be sold, to ensure that sales are limited to the cleanest fuels available. Finally, staff recommends that Council direct staff to begin work on developing a cap on Airport emissions. These actions are recommended as options for protecting the community's health and welfare, aligning Airport operations with the City's environmental values, and better shielding the City from liability. The report also discusses other proposals, including banning aircraft based on engine ratings, terminating FBO leases, and closing the Western Parcel; and the report notes other possible alternatives.", "Background", "The adverse impacts of Airport operations have been a major source of concern to the community for half a century. And, the City's efforts to regulate those impacts have spawned legal disputes and litigation throughout that time. Detailed information about the history of the Airport and the legal battles relating to its operations is included in staff's report of March 24, 2015, among several others.", "The first efforts by the City to curtail adverse Airport impacts focused on the noise impacts of early jets. The City Council adopted a package of six ordinances, including a jet ban. Litigation erupted, setting the tone for the fractious decades that followed. The 1984 Settlement Agreement brought a brief hiatus to the City's disputes with the federal government; however, Airport neighbors, Airport businesses, and other aviation interests continued to make claims against the City. In the last fifteen years, disputes and litigation between the City and the federal government, Airport neighbors and Airport businesses have been virtually constant.", "During this time, aircraft emissions from both jets and piston aircraft have been a growing source of concern and conflict. Most piston aircraft are fueled by aviation gasoline (avgas), which commonly contains the additive tetraethyl lead and therefore generates lead emissions that may be inhaled or ingested. At certain concentrations, such emissions may be toxic to the human nervous system, especially for children. Jet fuels do not contain lead. However, turbine engines on jet aircraft emit carbon dioxide and ultrafine particles, which threaten both the environment and human health.", "The debates here in Santa Monica about how to address the adverse impacts of aircraft emissions reflect national and world-wide debate on the subject of emissions from commercial aircraft. The Center for American Progress reports that aviation accounts for 13 percent of global transportation carbon dioxide emissions, and emissions from aviation are expected to quadruple by 2050 if left unchecked. Moreover, aviation's impact on air quality is not limited to carbon dioxide. Other greenhouse gases emitted by aircraft include water vapor, black carbon, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides; and their impacts are particularly detrimental because these gases are emitted by commercial aircraft directly into the upper atmosphere.", "Governments around the world have taken varied approaches. The European Union (EU) introduced aviation into its emissions trading system in 2008. The EU estimates that including aviation in its trading system will reduce aviation emissions by more than 70 million tons annually.", "The United States has moved much more slowly. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets emissions standards for aircraft engines, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies engines and enforces federal emissions standards. However these agencies have not yet established regulations governing aircraft emissions. In June of this year, the EPA announced the first steps towards proposing regulations. However, the agency also said that it would wait for current international negotiations limiting emissions before publishing final rules. Thus, the process will take years.", "Meanwhile, the federal government continues to support development work on biofuels. And, the FAA touts development of its satellite-based air traffic management system (NextGen), which will reduce fuel consumption and attendant emissions because it will facilitate more direct routing and reduce circling while awaiting landing clearance to land. However, net environmental gains from this project appear highly unlikely given the projected increase in air travel.", "While the federal government plods forward on efforts to reduce harmful aircraft emissions, efforts in California have yielded some success. For instance, last December, the Center for Environmental Health announced that litigation in Northern California had yielded a settlement whereby 30 companies that sell and/or distribute lead-containing avgas at 23 California Airports (including Santa Monica Airport) will offer for sale the lowest-lead fuel that is commercially available. They will also, upon request, make ethanol-free premium gasoline available. It is an FAA-approved fuel; and it is, or can be made compatible with more than 70 percent of piston aircraft.", "The City's efforts to address aircraft emissions have been ongoing for at least fifteen years. An ad hoc study group composed of members of the Environmental Task Force and the Airport Commission studied the issues and, in 2002, requested that the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) take various actions, including studying the impacts of General Aviation on air quality, characterizing levels of toxicity in communities around GA airports, and determining the impact of aircraft emissions on measured pollutant levels. AQMD conducted a study in 2006-7. It measured lead, carbon, ultrafine particulars and volatile organic compounds, among other things. The agency's conclusions included that lead levels in communities near the runway did not exceed federal standards and that the concentration of ultrafine particles was significantly elevated near runways during aircraft operations; but, in general, the Airport's impact on air pollution was difficult to distinguish from pollution caused by automobiles and other motor vehicles.", "In 2009, the City Council adopted an Airport Sustainability Plan as an addendum to the Sustainable City Plan. The Airport plan was reviewed and recommended by both the Task Force on the Environment and the Airport Commission. As to air quality, the plan requires: advocacy with federal and state agencies for reductions in emissions and alternative fuels, support for studies and monitoring of emissions to serve as the basis for advances in emission controls, and or reduced taxiing and hold times (which generate high concentrations of emissions). That plan has been implemented.", "In 2010, the AQMD study was augmented when the suspension of all Airport operations for runway repaving presented an unusual opportunity to assess SMO's impacts. The AQMD concluded that the suspension of Airport operations resulted in a \"substantial decrease\" in measured ultra- fine particles and black carbon pollution. Measurements taken on the eastern tarmac showed that concentrations of ultra-fine particles were 12 to 17 times higher when the Airport was operating. Measurements taken at the closest home showed that levels were four to seven times higher when the Airport was operating. Additionally, the AQMD reported that aircraft idling near the runway before and during departure generated very high concentrations of ultra-fine particles over short time periods. These concentrations were as high as 600 times background levels.", "Also in 2010, the EPA conducted a study of lead emissions. The agency's primary purpose was to develop a modeling approach to quantify the effect of emissions from piston-engine aircraft on local ambient lead levels. A secondary purpose was to monitor air, soil and dust lead concentrations, including the possibility of lead-emission intrusions into indoor spaces. The EPA explained that SMO was selected because: the monitoring study conducted by AQMD laid a good foundation; SMO has excellent data collection regarding piston-engine aircraft operations; and Santa Monica is a busy general aviation airport within a densely populated location. In particular, the EPA noted that 6500 people live within 0.5 km of the Airport.", "The EPA reported that its air quality monitoring showed modeled concentrations at two sites with three-month averages above federal air quality standards. The agency identified four factors as most significantly impacting concentrations of lead in the air: engine \"run-up check\" duration, taxi-out time, the percentage of twin-engine aircraft operations, and the lead concentration in the fuel. As to lead concentration in fuel, the agency noted that two samples of avgas had lead concentrations 20% higher than specifications established by the American Society of Testing and Matter, which develops fuel specifications. Soil and dust samples showed no elevated lead levels above area averages on the Airport or in local parks. However, sampling taken inside two homes showed elevated levels (though the EPA speculated that sources other than the Airport might be involved). Reports and presentations on both these studies are available to the public at the Airport website.", "In addition to the AQMD and EPA studies, scientists at UCLA also conducted studies. Those scientists concluded, among other things, that aircraft operations at SMO caused elevated concentrations of ultrafine particles and other pollutants downwind as far as 660 meters from the source. They surmised that the long downwind impact distance was primarily due to the large volumes of air craft emissions, which contain higher initial concentrations of particles than on-road vehicle exhaust. The UCLA studies were presented to the Airport Commission in 2014 and were the basis of recommendations that the Council consider adopting an ordinance that would restrict aircraft usage of the Airport based on engine ratings.", "The Airport Commission also conducted a workshop on the development and marketing of alternative aviation fuels. Representatives described their companies' formulation of \"drop in\" jet biofuels, which they anticipated would be widely available within a few years. Because they blend directly with petroleum jet fuel, such fuels would eliminate or reduce the need to modify aircraft, aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure. A representative of another company described the Piston Alternative Fuels Initiative, which will facilitate FAA evaluation of unleaded fuels for propeller aircraft. He estimated that such fuels will be readily available by 2018.", "In recent years, community members' complaints about emissions have increased. During the comprehensive Airport Visioning Process, the health impacts of aircraft emissions and the inconsistency of the Airport's adverse environmental impacts with the City's core values ranked high among community concerns. More recently, demands for City action to curtail adverse impacts have continued to mount, with emissions and their impacts on human health and the environment becoming a primary community focus.", "This year, in response to those demands, the City Council has considered adverse Airport impacts on multiple occasions. On March 24, 2015, after considering a staff report on future options for Airport operations and land use, Council provided direction on Airport leasing policy, approving the general direction that action should be taken to reduce adverse impacts of Airport operations, through lease conditions and other lawful means. On May 12, 2015, Council gave direction on the specific subject of emissions. The motion was to direct staff to return to Council, as soon as possible, with strategies to reduce air pollution, such strategies to be practical, include lease provisions curtailing pollution, and minimize risks of preemption. Likewise, on July 14th, Council directed staff to, among other things, return with information about options for fuel sales, about regulating emissions through lease terms, and about environmental remediation. This report responds to those directions.", "Discussion", "There is certainly no dispute as to the paramount importance of addressing adverse Airport impacts in order to protect community health and our environment. Nor is there any dispute that harmful aircraft emissions pose risks to both. Moreover, they also pose liability risks to the City. Neighbors have previously sued the City over aircraft emissions and have threatened to do so again. Notably, in the larger, ongoing global effort to address harmful effects of aircraft emissions, even aviation interests acknowledge that emissions must be reduced and aircraft fuels must be improved. However, local governments face significant challenges in this area because the federal and state governments exercise substantial control. Given this practical and legal context, the question for Santa Monica is how best to act locally to reduce aircraft emissions from the City's airport.", "Staff is recommending Council consideration of five possibilities for City action, each of which is discussed in this section:", "1. Requiring fuel providers to convert to sales of cleaner fuels", "2. Requiring fuel providers to begin the cleanup of any contamination on their leaseholds", "3.

Requiring flight schools to convert to cleaner fuels", "5. Assessing the development of a cap for Airport emissions", "Additionally, this section discusses, but does not recommend, adoption of an ordinance regulating access to the Airport based on aircraft engine emissions. Also discussed, but not recommended, is the proposal from some community members to ameliorate adverse impacts, including emissions, by eliminating Fixed Base Operator (FBO) services or closing the Western Parcel.", "Limiting Fuel Sales by FBO\u2019s Through Lease Provisions", "Staff proposed prompt action to reduce emissions (and other adverse impacts) contractually through leasing policy. The Airport leases all expired this year. This event is very important because it affords the opportunity for the City, as proprietor and landlord, to both increase rents to market value (so that residents are not at risk of subsidizing the Airport\u2019s operations) and to impose new requirements upon lessees.", "Such requirements could relate to fuel sales. The type of fuels sold at the Airport will directly impact the composition of emissions. And, regulating types of fuels sold is a reasonable means to achieve the ends of protecting public health, safeguarding the environment and shielding the City from liability.", "Currently utilized aircraft fuels yield emissions that endanger both public health and the environment. A wealth of evidence establishes this fact. The federal government acknowledges it and has joined the world-wide effort to develop cleaner fuels and limit aircraft emissions. Even the aviation community acknowledges the need for change. For example, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) has told the Environmental Protection Agency that AOPA is committed to \u201can unleaded future.\u201d However, progress on the development and distribution of cleaner fuels is frustratingly slow.", "The ponderous pace is difficult to justify or even explain. Resources are available. As to jet aircraft, federal agencies, the military, and airline corporations are working jointly to develop and distribute biofuels. They are already widely available for commercial aircraft and are used as a \u201cdrop in\u201d (meaning they are simply added to standard fuels and used in existing engines); but using biofuels as a drop in for general aviation aircraft is problematic. So efforts to formulate and market cleaner fuels for private jets are lagging behind.", "As to piston-driven aircraft engines, unleaded and low-lead fuel are available. Some newer aircraft engines are designed to utilize them. Moreover, most older piston-powered aircraft can use them, once appropriate certification is obtained. Staff estimates that such certification costs between $500 and $1,000 per aircraft. Indeed, many aircraft owners would prefer to use cleaner fuels because they reduce engine \u201cgunk\u201d.", "The problem is making such fuels available sooner, rather than later. The future is, indeed, \u201cunleaded\u201d, Santa Monica simply needs to hasten its coming for the community\u2019s health and welfare. Airport neighbors and persons living in surrounding communities complain that their yards are covered with soot, and they are afraid to let their children play outside. The situation is apparently most dire for neighbors living just west of the Airport. Their homes are within 300 feet of the runway end. One neighbor, who traveled to Washington to testify to FAA officials in July, stated that she cannot even open her windows for fear that the emissions will permeate her indoor living space.", "These circumstances pose liability risks for the City, and the risks have increased in recent years. About 15 years ago, when neighbors last sued the City claiming damages for noise and emissions, significantly less information was available about aircraft emissions and their impact on health. Most important, the studies on Airport emissions, which are described in the Background section of this report, had not yet been done. The next such lawsuit may well be more difficult to defend.", "While the risks posted by emissions to residents and to the City are clear and substantial, any potential harm to aviation interest in regulating fuel sales through reasonable lease terms is not. Establishing leasing requirements related to cleaner fuels need to be significantly detrimental to aviation interests. Such requirements would not deprive Airport users of access to the Airport. Nor would they preclude FBO\u2019s from doing business at the Airport.", "Cleaner fuels exist, and fuel providers know that they must make them available in Southern California. As noted above, a litigation settlement reached in Northern California requires 30 companies that sell and/or distribute lead-containing aviation gas (avgas) to sell cleaner fuel. Both of the companies that sell fuel at the Airport are bound by that settlement agreement. Presumably, they have made progress on that mandate since executing the settlement agreement. Lease provisions requiring them to sell cleaner fuels would not impose new burdens. Instead, they would simply spur faster progress.", "Nor would aircraft owners be unduly burdened. Most piston-aircraft do not need avgas to operate. Ethanol-free premium automotive gas and unleaded aviation gasoline are compatible with 70% of piston aircraft. And, the FAA has approved their use with a Supplemental Type Certificate, which may be obtained by aircraft owners for a cost that staff estimates between $500 and $1000. As to jets, biofuels exist. Commercial carriers have been using biofuels for some time. Perhaps their distribution into the world of general aviation interests would be hastened by demands from those interests.", "Moreover, aircraft owners and operators have choices about where to buy their fuel. Lease restriction on what fuels are sold at SMO would, of course, not prevent any owner or pilot from purchasing fuel elsewhere.", "Based upon all these considerations, staff recommends that Council provide direction to staff to develop lease terms that limit the sale of aviation fuels. Specifically, staff proposes that lease terms prohibit the sale of leaded fuels and highly polluting jet fuels after a date or dates certain. Council could consider different dates for the two classes of fuel depending upon the most current information on availability of cleaner fuels. After that date or dates, piston aircraft fuel sales would be limited to low lead or unleaded. Jet fuel sales would be limited to biofuels or other environmentally preferable fuel.", "Requiring Lessees That Sell Aircraft Fuel to Begin Cleaning Up Any Contamination on Their Leaseholds", "Current lease provisions make lessees responsible for environmental cleanup of the property. However, that responsibility is linked to termination of the leases. At present, the lessees that sell fuel are on hold-over status with short-term leases, while the Council awaits a staff report on subleasing and the possibility of its elimination. So, the lessees are not obligated to being cleaned up at present.", "Council could advance the cleanup obligations as part of its ongoing effort to facilitate and protect City options for the land\u2019s future use. This approach may be prudent, given the fact that contamination levels would need to be thoroughly assessed before a remediation program could be devised and approved, the fuel providers do not have long-term leases at present, and the cleanup work could take years.", "Assessing the Possibility of Eliminating Third-Party Fuel Sales and the City Taking over Fuel Sales, for However Long as Fuel is Sold at the Airport", "At present fuel sales at the Airport are conducted by two lessees. As noted above, both of them are bound by a litigation settlement to sell cleaner fuels for piston aircraft when those fuels become available. However, how rigorously that settlement will be enforced is unknown. And, in any event, the settlement does not cover jet fuel sales. Therefore, Council may want an assessment of the costs and benefits of the City taking over all fuel sales at the Airport.", "Staff notes that historic precedent exists; the City sold aircraft fuel at the Airport in the past. Moreover, aircraft fuel can be sold from trucks \u2013 an approach that could facilitate any required cleanup of the underground tank facilities and avoid additional ground contamination.", "Eliminating the Use of Leaded Fuels by Flight Schools", "In addition to limiting fuel sales through lease provisions, staff also recommends lease terms that require flight schools to use unleaded or low-lead fuels. This recommendation is based on several considerations including the physical circumstances of the Airport, the unusually large number of flight schools at the Airport, and the particularly adverse impacts of patterned flying on air quality.", "SMO\u2019s physical circumstances make it a particularly poor location for flight training. Homes are in very close proximity to runway ends, and there are no runway safety facilities, partly because the runway ends are so unusually close to the Airport perimeter. Moreover, the runway is on a plateau above surrounding residential neighborhoods. This has led to the observation that taking off and landing there is a little like landing on the deck of an air craft carrier. Yet, in recent years, there have been as many as seven flight schools operating at once at the Airport; and there have been several accidents including flight-school students.", "Complaints about the flight schools\u2019 impacts have been constant because patterned flying over a relatively small area in the vicinity of the Airport creates extremely detrimental impacts upon Airport neighbors. The factual basis of those complaints is confirmed by the results of studies describe in the Background section of this report. Thus, the dangers know to be associated with lead emissions, the particularly intense adverse impacts of patterned flying, the harm to adjacent communities, and the potential for City liability all justify prohibiting the use of leaded fuel by flight schools through lease terms.", "Moreover, the harm to flight school operations would not outweigh harm to the community and potential harm to the City of incorporating such terms into flight school leases. Most, if not all, of the aircraft presently used by the flight schools at the Airport can operate on unleaded or low lead fuel. One of the schools already utilizes an aircraft designed to operate on unleaded fuels. And certification is available for most, if not all, of the other aircraft used for flight training. Additionally, the unusually large number f flight schools at the Airport means that flight training would likely remain available at the Airport even if certain flight school operators made a business decision to leave the Airport rather than agreeing to lease terms prohibiting the use of leaded fuels.", "Finally, to ensure fairness to flight school operators, staff suggests that current lessees be afforded a reasonable, but not extended, amount of time to obtain certification, convert their fleets or otherwise implement the proposed new requirement.", "Developing the Possibility of a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cap for the Airport", "Staff also recommends that Council give direction to begin work on developing greenhouse gas emissions cap for the Airport. Such a cap could afford another means of controlling adverse impacts on neighbors and reducing the City\u2019s liability risks as owner and operator of the Airport. This undertaking would be completely consistent with the City\u2019s commitment to serving as a leader on environmental issues. It would advance the goals of the City\u2019s Sustainability Plan. It would also effectuate the City\u2019s Sustainability Rights Ordinance, whereby Council recognized that the peoples\u2019 rights include the right to clean indoor and outdoor air and that, to the full extent legally possible, short-term, private interest must be subordinated to the common, long-term interest of achieving environmental and economic sustainability for the community as a whole. Moreover, development of an emissions cap would also harmonize with President Obama\u2019s and Governor Brown\u2019s declared intent to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "This effort would likely include, among other things: gathering information about and measuring Airport emissions; formulating proposals and models for the cap\u2019s operation; and crafting remedies for exceeding the cap. Presumably, potential remedies could include reducing or eliminating certain activities particularly likely to exacerbate or contribute to emissions. Flight training, fuel sales and other FBO operations might be among those activities.", "At this point, an emissions cap is, of necessity, merely a very general concept. Doubtless such an effort would generate legal opposition, including challenges to the City legal authority to impose a cap. However, staff believes that the approach holds significant promise and that there is legal authority for the proposition that federal law does not preempt local plans for reducing emissions from sites or facilities (as opposed to moving sources such as vehicles or engines). See National Association of Home Builders v. San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District., 627 F.3d 730 (9th Cir. 2010). Obviously, developing this approach to reducing emissions would take time and resources. However, staff anticipates s that assistance would be available from he local environmental community and perhaps other sources.", "This approach obviously involves many unknowns. Nonetheless, given the existing and mounting scientific evidence of the health and environmental risks posed by greenhouse gases, including those generated by Airport operations, the federal and state governments\u2019 efforts and calls to action, the community\u2019s demands for action, the unaccountably slow pace of the federal effort on regulating emissions, and the City\u2019s core commitment to sustainability, staff recommends evaluating this alternative.", "Imposing Regulatory Limits on Aircraft Engines", "Community members prepare and presented to the Airport Commission a carefully considered and documented proposal for regulating emissions by ordinance. It has been discussed previously but is also discussed here because the regulation of emission by ordinance is an appealing approach.", "Under the proposed ordinance, aircraft with emissions ratings for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides above specified levels would be excluded from the Airport. The proposed exclusion would be phased in, with the emissions limits being lowered over the phase-in period. Specifically the proposal was that no aircraft with engines rate 40 or more pounds per hour in hydrocarbons in idle mode or 200 pounds or more per hour in oxides of nitrogen in take-off mode should be prohibited from operating at the Airport. The ordinance would step these limits down every six months until the limits would be ten pounds per hour in hydrocarbons in idle mode or 80 pounds or more in oxide of nitrogen per hour in take-off mode. Thereafter, the proposed ordinance would require a 5% reduction each year, unless the Airport Commission decided to forbear on further reductions.", "Staff respects the careful thought and extensive work that went into the development of this proposal. It is evidence-based and rationally conceived, and the evidence provided by the study is both informative and useful to the City in formulating policy on emissions. However, as explained in staff\u2019s report to Council of March 24, 2105, the federal Clean Air Act preempts local regulation of aircraft engines and emissions. Section 233 of the act provides that \u201cNo state or political subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any standard respecting emissions of any air pollutant from any aircraft or engine thereof unless such standard is identical to a standard applicable to such aircraft under (this Act).\u201d In State Air Resources Board v. Department of the Navy, 431 F. Supp. 1271 (ND Cal. 1977), the federal court explained that \u201cThe preemptive intent of Section 233 is explicit; the states are clearly preempted from adopting or enforcing regulation respecting emissions of any air pollutant from any aircraft or engine thereof... .\u201d The court went on to explain that Congress intended to preempt state and local regulation of aircraft emissions because allowing the states to set 50 different standards for \u201cmoving sources\u201d of pollution would (in the words of the Supreme Court) amount to impermissible harassment of the national aviation system and industry.", "This means that, although the suggested ordinance appears to have considerable merit, the City Council does not have the authority to adopt it because the Council, like other state and local bodies, has no power to adopt regulations governing aircraft emissions. They are the province of the federal government as illustrated by the EPA\u2019s action of last June, when the EPA announced that it would begin initial efforts toward proposing regulations on aircraft engine emissions.", "Proponents of the ordinance have argued that preemption does not apply because the City\u2019s proprietary powers (as owners of the Airport) trump the preemptive effect of the Clean Air Act. Moreover, proponents of the ordinance and others have argued that, despite long odds, the City should adopt the proposed ordinance because of the importance of protecting the environment and public health and because they believe the City has little to lose and everything to gain.", "Unfortunately, staff must disagree on both points. As explained in the staff report of March 24, 2105, the court decision cited in support of adopting the ordinance is inapposite. Rather than establishing that airport proprietors are not preempted from regulating emissions, it actually stands for the proposition that states (and cities) may base purchasing decisions about purchasing equipment on emissions, much as Santa Monica does in purchasing motor vehicles.", "As to potential risks, banning certain types of aircraft through regulatory action would undoubtedly provoke litigation. Aviation interests have already expressly threatened to challenge any attempt to ban aircraft based on emission ratings. Moreover, the FAA could, itself, institute action against the City. It could commence a Part 16 administrative proceeding, as it did when the City attempted to ban larger and faster jets to achieve runway safety. Or, it might issue a cease and desist order in the pending Part 16 proceeding, as it did previously in the runway safety litigation. If the FAA instituted a legal action, it would also likely seek a federal court injunction to halt implementation of the ban, just as the FAA did during the runway safety litigation. If history is any guide, a federal court would do so; and, depending upon its breadth, such an injunction could prevent the City from taking future actions to reduce the Airport\u2019s adverse impacts while the City and the community await resolution of the disputes about the grant expiration and the City\u2019s authority to control its land. This would be a significant loss of local control.", "The existing litigation will probably take years to resolve. During that time, it is crucial that the city protect its proprietary authority to reduce adverse impacts of airport operations through lease terms, continue to repurpose the non-aviation land to recreational use, and assess and address needs for remediation. Thus, staff recommends against regulating emission by an ordinance limiting Airport access.", "Terminating FBO Leases or Closing the Western Parcel in Order to Reduce Operations and Adverse Impacts, Including Emissions", "Some Airport neighbors have proposed terminating the FBO leases or removing the Western Parcel form aviation use to reduce operations and attendant adverse impacts. As to the FBO\u2019s, these residents argue that the City was obligated to maintain FBOs at the Airport only by the 1984 Agreement. Now that it has expired, they argue that the City, as proprietor/landlord, has the authority to terminate leases and thereby end the provision of aviation services, including fuel sales. As to the Western Parcel, they argue that it is not covered by the Instrument of Transfer; so, the City can close it now.", "However, the FAA contends that the grant conditions remain in effect until 2023, and the agency interprets the grant conditions to require the provision of basic aviation services, which are among those provided by FBO\u2019s. And, the Western Parcel is covered by the grant conditions. Thus, shutting down the FBO\u2019s or attempting to close the Western Parcel would very likely trigger another Part 16 proceeding.", "Residents favoring these approaches argue that the FAA might simply step aside and allow the FBO\u2019s to close or the Western Parcel to be removed from aviation use; and, in any event they echo the view that the City has little to lose and much to gain. The appeal of these proposed approaches in readily understandable. Without aviation services, Airport operations would decline, which would diminish impacts. Without the Western Parcel, the Airport\u2019s runways would be shortened and many aircraft, particularly larger jets, would be unable to use the Airport.", "Staff agrees with the premise that, in order to protect community health, safety and welfare, the City must depend upon and effectuate its rights as proprietor and landlord. Staff also agrees that the litigation is taking a frustratingly long time. Indeed, much longer than it should in the case of the Part 16 proceeding wherein the FAA has extended its own deadline for issuing the initial Part 16 decision three times without meaningful explanation. Also, the City has waited months for the oral argument in the Ninth Circuit, though this waiting time is typical for that court. Meanwhile, Airport neighbors continue to suffer adverse impacts from Airport operations; and their frustrations mount.", "Nonetheless, staff cannot agree that the City should simply notify the FAA that the City is shutting down FBO\u2019s or closing the Western Parcel. Staff\u2019s considered opinion is that these actions would not bring faster relief and both would pose significant risk to the City\u2019s short-term ability to reduce adverse impacts and perhaps even to its long-term success in achieving ultimate goals.", "The argument that the FAA might simply agree to allow the City to close the FBO\u2019s or the Western Parcel is not supported by history or any applicable evidence. In the past, particularly during the runway safety dispute, the federal government acted aggressively to stop the City from curtailing operations. The FAA, itself, commenced the Part 16 proceeding challenging the City\u2019s ability to conform usage of the Airport to its federal designation, which reflects its facilities. The Agency also issues a cease and desist order in that case, arguably stretching its authority to do so because it had not yet held a hearing. Moreover, when the case moved from the agency and into the court, the Justice Department assigned some of its most experienced and able attorneys to the runway safety litigation. Those same senior attorneys have been assigned to the current federal litigation, filed by the City to establish its authority to control use of the land. These are simply not the actions of an entity ready to step aside and duck a fight.", "And, there is other evidence of the FAA\u2019s determination to keep SMO in operation. The FAA continues to push for long-term leases for its facilities at the Airport. Also, it is designing Nextgen on the assumption that SMO will continue to operate. And, senior FAA staff has told the City, they are \u201cnot in the business of closing airports.\u201d Thus, the federal government\u2019s conduct gives no hint that it is willing to allow the City to make a different use of the City\u2019s land now occupied by the Airport. As Congressman Lieu\u2019s Chief of Staff confirmed at the meeting in Washington this summer, the FAA simply has no intention of voluntarily letting go of SMO.", "The hope that it might is apparently based on the agency\u2019s actions as to other airports with different circumstances. It is true that the FAA occasionally agrees to allow an airport to close or steps aside from a closure fight (usually leaving the fight to private aviation interests). The example most often cited is Miegs Field in Chicago where Mayor Daily had the runway bulldozed in the middle of the night. However, the facts of that situation are quite different than Santa Monica\u2019s. For example, Miegs Field was on land owned by the Chicago Park District and leased to the City for airport usage; and the Park District refused to renew the lease to the City. Thus, in contrast to Santa Monica, the owner of the land was not the operator of the Airport. This meant, among other things, that the land owner was not federally obligated through the receipt of airport improvement grants. Moreover, the FAA did not view Miegs Field as vital to aviation interests, given other airports in the vicinity. Its relative inaction on the Miegs closure probably reflects this fact and the federal and state politics surrounding the controversy. In any event, the Miegs experience does not establish bulldozing a runway as a viable means of asserting local control over an airport. And, it certainly does not establish a precedent upon which Santa Monica can rely given the difference in the circumstances.", "The FAA previously determined that use of the Airport was a local land use matter after expiration of the 1984 Settlement Agreement, but the agency reversed its position on local control years ago. For the last few years, it has continuously asserted that Santa Monica has ongoing grant obligation until 2023, that the FAA has perpetual reversionary rights as to the land occupied by the Airport, and that the Airport\u2019s continued operation as a reliever for Los Angeles International Airport is vital to national interests. These assertions and the Agencies other actions belie the supposition that the FAA would stand idly by if the City acted to shut down FBO\u2019s or close the Western Parcel to aviation use.", "Instead, the likely result would be a federal injunction that would preserve the status quo and could prevent the City from taking any action to bring relief to Airport neighbors while the legal disputes are ongoing. Therefore, staff opposes attempting to reduce emissions and other adverse impacts by either terminating FBO leases or attempting to close the Western Parcel to aviation use.", "Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to establishing the City\u2019s authority to control use of the land. The City can only establish control by judicial decision or Congressional action. Congressional action is possible, but very unlikely in the near future. The legal process is slow; however, it does achieve results, and is ongoing.", "While it is, the City\u2019s decision about the Airport should be carefully considered in order to maximize the chances of ultimate success in the courts. The land is the City\u2019s most valuable physical asset. And, the community demands that the land be used in a manner that serves the community\u2019s interests. The struggle for control and locally-determined use of this City asset is more likely to succeed if conducted strategically and thoughtfully with a constant eye on the ultimate prize.", "However, this does not mean that the City\u2019s ultimate goals are unattainable or that adverse impacts cannot be reduced while the City moves towards its long-term goals. Reduction of emissions through lease provisions is one area where gains may be attained in the relatively near future and should be pursued.", "Alternatives", "Instead of taking action as the Airport\u2019s proprietor and operator, the City could wait on external developments to alleviate the problems posed by emissions. As described in this report, cleaner fuels already exist and they are becoming available. The two fuel providers at the Airport have already agreed in settlement of litigation brought by the Center for Environmental Health to begin providing cleaner fuel. Also, aircraft engines are becoming more efficient. However, this progress is slow. And, meanwhile the community suffers, the City is at legal risk, and the Airport operates in a manner that is inconsistent with the City\u2019s core environmental values. Therefore, staff recommends against waiting for the federal government or aviation interests to solve the community\u2019s emissions problem.", "Council could also consider incentivizing emissions reductions. For instance, Council could explore committing City resources to assisting lessees and aircraft owner/operators with a conversion to clean fuels in order to speed up the process. For example, the City could subsidize all or a portion of the cost of obtaining the certification necessary to use low lead or no lead fuel. Staff is not recommending this approach at this time for reasons including cost and a likely lack of community support.", "Or, as discussed above, the City could ban certain aircraft with certain engine ratings, terminate FBO leases, or attempt to close the Western Parcel. These actions would please some. However, they would likely not achieve the short term goal of achieving relief from adverse impacts and could be very detrimental to accomplishment of the City\u2019s long term-goals. Such actions would be very likely to draw legal challenges from aviation interests or the FAA, itself. The City would likely not prevail against those challenges and might very well end up enjoined from further action to alleviate adverse Airport impacts. Thus, staff recommends against these alternatives. However, Council may wish to consider more moderate measures, such as reducing the hours of FBO operations to curtail adverse impacts or ending all aviation leasing on the Western Parcel in order to minimize adverse impacts and prepare for potential future uses. Overall, staff continues to counsel a steadfast but measured approach including: regaining control of the land through the pending legal proceedings and by working with members of Congress; effectuating the voters\u2019 vision for the land by repurposing the non-aviation land and taking other steps to ready the land for the future; and using all lawful means to reduce adverse impacts of Airport operations. And, if certain of the particular measures recommended in this report for reducing emissions prove to be unworkable or inadequate to reduce emissions, Council can always explore additional measures.", "Next Steps", "If Council directs staff to modify lease provisions relating to fuel sales and use, staff will work to modify the leases and report back to Council. Depending upon Council\u2019s exact direction and the results of staff\u2019s work, that report will either be made by Information Item or in conjunction with the report to Council on subleasing. Staff will also return with information on costs and benefits of taking over all fuel sales and on developing an emissions cap if so directed.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "Modification of lease provisions, including limitations on fuel sales and restriction on flights schools\u2019 use of specific fuels could impact Airport revenues, though impacts are difficult to predict. If Council takes action that fosters litigation, there will be costs, which are also difficult to predict because they depend on the nature of the challenge. The costs of exploring a greenhouse gas emissions cap are unknown at this time. Consulting services would obviously be required. So, costs could be significant. Likewise cost of taking over all fuel sales would need to be assessed.", "#1"]}], [{"Title": "Appointment to one unscheduled vacancy on the Housing Commission fora term ending 6/30/2017.", "Department": "City Clerk 13-Items", "Sponsors": null, "Category": "13.

These include compliance with Building and Fire Codes for commercial and residential space, inclusion of floor drains, slop sinks, flooring and finishes that support a working studio, high volume gallery-type space, consideration for ventilation with flexibility for installation of mechanical ventilation if necessary, consideration for storage of potentially toxic or hazardous materials related to art production, loading dock access, and electrical power. Typically, such units are located on the ground floor due to the need for access. As a result, there would likely be challenges in designing artists units due to their location in the upper floors of a multi-story building.", "Given Santa Monica\u2019s aging population with persons aged 55 and over representing approximately 25 percent of the population, seniors may be considered an appropriate target population. There currently are limited options for affordable senior housing in Santa Monica.", "Another population to consider would be hotel workers, since the project includes a hotel use. This could also be expanded to include all Downtown workers. While there are many Downtown workers employed in the entertainment and technology industries that tend to pay higher wages, this is balanced by food services and hospitality that tend to pay lower wages. Fair Housing law would limit the ability of the housing to be restricted to hotel workers or Downtown workers. However, housing could be marketed toward local workers, with the City\u2019s local preferences giving such workers an edge in competing for housing. As Downtown workers who cannot afford market-rate housing earn a range of incomes, the affordability levels of the housing would affect which workers would qualify. Note that 60 percent of Area Median Income (AMI) is the maximum threshold at which affordable housing can qualify for tax credits.

Some of the results were surprising to staff and KMA. For example, the residential market is currently very strong within Santa Monica and the region, as rents continue to rise and the demand for housing is very deep. However, replacing office with housing was the weakest performer among the alternatives. Thetwo primary reasons are: (1) the construction of the building is very expensive relative to the rents that housing can achieve and (2) the building does not lend itself easily to residential use, resulting in a significant loss of leasable space.", "The hotel market is also very strong and typically can support high-value construction. However, there is a loss in leasable space when the portions of the building planned for office are converted to hotel use, resulting in an alternative that has less value than the proposed office use. Any changes that involve an increase in hotel use, while likely eliminating ground lease revenues to the City, would result in increased transient occupancy taxes. However, a larger hotel use may be considered a more speculative development with a higher risk profile. A riskier profile could make it more difficult to obtain equity investors and permanent financing, potentially resulting in delays in commencing construction and delivering the public objectives.", "For any of the options that involve a reduction or elimination of office use without replacement by another use, a significant overhaul of the project design would be expected. Replacement of the office use with an alternative use would also affect the project design, though the impacts are not expected to be as significant.", "The primary trade-off associated with alternative uses is the impact on the four identified public objectives.

Given the site\u2019s location, a park at the site would most likely be successful if it were designed as an urban or downtown park, rather than a neighborhood park. Examples of successful urban parks include Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland and Bryant Park in New York City. Successful urban parks are typically distinguished by a focus on creating features and programs that ensure that the park is used by a variety of community members throughout the day, including weekdays, weekends and evenings. Another characteristic of such successful urban parks, including Pioneer Courthouse Square and Bryant Park, are public/private partnerships whereby the parks are programmed, managed, and operated by non-profit entities.", "While a typical neighborhood park may be successful with trees, grass, and little programming, such a park can be challenging in an urban environment, particularly because one segment of a community can take over a park and make other members of a community feel unwelcome. Bryant Park in New York City provides a prime example. In spite of its location adjacent to a public library and surrounded by an incredible density of residents, workers, and shoppers, the simple and unprogrammed park became a place that most people feared. The park was turned around by a set of measures related to programming, careful management of amenities, and features such as food pavilions. Today, Bryant Park is one of the most treasured urban parks in the United States.", "Creating a successful public park on the site would require the level of design and programming that has made other urban parks successful. The need at the location would be heightened because it currently has very few \u201ceyes on the park\u201d from adjacent buildings, which largely turn their backs on the site. Because of the great fondness that the community has developed for the seasonal ice skating rink on the site, systems that allow for easy conversion of a portion of the park to the skating rink would likely be necessary. Given the City\u2019s recent experience with Tongva Park, in addition to the continuing increase in construction costs for public open spaces, costs to build a park at the site could range from $10 million to $25 million, depending on the features desired in the park. In addition, the leases of the current on-site banks would need to be addressed. Buying the banks out of their leases could cost between $5 million and $10 million. To avoid paying the buy-out costs, the park would need to be delayed until 2025, when both leases will have expired.", "If the proposed public parking were desired under the park, it would add an additional $17 million to $20 million to the cost of the park, though some of the costs would be offset by the capitalized value of the net parking revenue. On-going costs would include maintenance and programming of the park, estimated at $1 million to $3 million per year, depending on the design and desired level of programming.", "LUCE and Draft Downtown Specific Plan Consistency", "While ability to achieve public objectives is one method to determine tradeoffs in use mix, another method might be to view the project from a land use public policy perspective of the uses to be created within the project and downtown.

Additionally, studies have also indicated that workers have a greater propensity than residents to take transit in areas closest to transit. Consequently, the creative office use on the project site is located in an ideal location to increase the probability for transit use (i.e. within \u00bc mile). Further trip reduction is more effective for non-residential uses due to predictability in commute behavior, ability to affect commute trips, and ability to offer financial incentives.", "The Draft DSP builds upon the strategy adopted in the LUCE and presents a similarly balanced approach to address the competing priorities of additional housing, economic sustainability, and trip reduction. The Draft DSP recognizes that the vitality of the creative industry is a critical piece of Santa Monica\u2019s healthy and diverse economy. Maintaining the ability for businesses to start-up, grow, and evolve within Santa Monica is an important competitive advantage to avoid creative businesses relocating to West Los Angeles, Playa Vista, and other areas that compete for these companies. The Draft DSP acknowledges that a major economic challenge is office space availability, which limits expansion opportunities for existing businesses and impedes new businesses from locating in Santa Monica.", "The Draft DSP similarly recognizes the need to continue to support housing in the Downtown area with development incentives such as additional height and floor area ratio (FAR) for housing projects. However, in order to appropriately address the current jobs/housing imbalance, housing units need to be available for a range of incomes beyond what is identified as affordable housing in the Affordable Housing Production Program (AHPP). Such housing may include workforce housing that is targeted at workers with incomes between moderate income and 180% of area median income. The construction of housing at rents affordable to Downtown workers\u2019 incomes would provide opportunities for these employees to work and live in the same area. The co-location of housing, neighborhood-serving retail and personal services, and employment supports daily vehicle trips reductions. There is a need to give equal consideration to the economic and housing needs of the City with the overarching goal being trip reduction. The project provides 48 housing units affordable to households making up to 50 percent of the area median income. While addressing the housing needs of one of the neediest segments of the community, it does not address the housing needs of those with higher incomes who nonetheless are unable to afford market-rate housing in Santa Monica. The project could address trip reduction through the TDM Plan and contributions to transportation improvements and programs that are difficult to fund, such as the citywide Transportation Management Association.", "Conceptual Business Terms", "Staff from the Economic Development Division and the City Attorney\u2019s office, with assistance from KMA, have evaluated the economic feasibility of the proposed development program as outlined in the project\u2019s original proposal pro forma (Attachment U).", "Since Council\u2019s authorization of exclusive negotiations on December10, 2013, staff and the Development Team have negotiated a frame work of conceptual business terms based on the proposed development program for the project.

There is no financial cost to the City to provide the program as the cost to utilize the service will be covered by car share members. The contractor would agree to performance criteria set by the City that address program characteristics including customer service, vehicle availability, greenhouse gas emissions and marketing. The City would provide a minimum of 20 on- and off-street parking spaces for the program. The car sharing program would offer members a fully automated online reservation and billing system that would provide access to a fleet of self-service vehicles strategically placed throughout the City. Development of this program is an important tool in contributing towards a reduction in vehicle ownership to promote alternative transportation modes to achieve the City's Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) goal of No Net New PM Peak Hour Vehicle Trips -- and the City\u2019s top Strategic Goal of establishing a new model for mobility. It is anticipated that the pilot public car share program would begin operation late in 2015, and provide the traditional model of roundtrip car sharing services.

Staff is recommending a pilot car share program to enable the provision of car sharing services in advance of the Expo Light Rail opening in a format that provides the flexibility to meet the needs of the City and current and future car share users. Research shows that car share members reduce their vehicle miles traveled (VMT), increase their use of other modes such as transit, bicycling and walking, and reduce their car ownership. Reduced car ownership also reduces parking demand and provides financial savings for households owning (and parking) fewer cars. The Automobile Club of Southern California estimates the cost to own and operate a vehicle in Southern California is $9,226 per year.

Through an AQMD grant for system development, the City contracted with Global Green USA, which reached out to explore the market and determine general level of interest and feasibility. The conclusion was that Santa Monica is a strong and attractive market for sponsors, with sufficient potential even if advertisement is limited to bicycles only, avoiding stationary fixtures in compliance with the Municipal Code. On November 11, 2014, Council directed the City Manager to pursue corporate sponsorship funding for its new bikeshare program, either directly or through an agency, that would provide a minimum of $250,000 per year and to return to Council with a sponsorship proposal.

The Superlative Group was selected based on these criteria, their superior valuation methodology, and their strong track record with public agency programs. As bike share is a new system in Los Angeles, their market evaluation to determine the right level for sponsorship afforded by placement of the company name and logo on the bicycles was particularly important. The negotiated commission-based agreement required Superlative to obtain a minimum of $250,000 annually for the City with a bonus if the contract exceeded a three year goal of $1,500,000 ($500,000 for three years) after commission.

The use of greywater for toilet flushing has recently been authorized by LA County Department of Public Health, however, the regulatory framework for installing such a system and the maintenance and testing requirements that follow are still in flux. In researching other multi-family residential projects around the country that have installed greywater systems, such projects tended to be on average 250 units, had obtained sizeable grants from a public utility, or were no longer using the greywater system due to maintenance difficulties. In speaking with manufacturers of greywater systems, it became clear that the cost of maintenance and regulatory compliance due to water testing is substantial. Further, the City has not yet developed a regulatory framework that would provide appropriate oversight for testing of greywater systems.

In the project\u2019s float-up review, the Commission also shared this concern in the lack of driveway visibility for public use. Staff reviewed alternate vehicle access points along both Lincoln Boulevard and Colorado Avenue that could have improved driveway visibility, however, the proposed driveway location is recommended for the project, given safety and overall circulation concerns associated with the driveway location along Lincoln Boulevard and Colorado Avenue.", "Staff considered the goals and policies of the Draft DSP as they relate to expanding public parking opportunities in Downtown and instead negotiated for use of 20 surplus parking spaces at the project site in order to provide the City options for integrating privately owned parking spaces into the public parking supply. With written notice, the City could exercise rights for 20 parking spaces in the subterranean garage. This option allows the City flexibility to consider the optimum parking location for employees who work in the downtown and purchase monthly parking permits. The framework is set up as a potential pilot program pursuant to the terms outlined in Section 2.7.21 of the development agreement that would require the project to make up to 20 monthly parking spaces available at the City\u2019s option at rates established by the parking rates resolution adopted by Council. This would potentially allow the City to relocate monthly parkers from public structures in the Downtown core to Downtown periphery locations. These parking spaces could be utilized by monthly parking permit employees who would be familiar with locating the project\u2019s subterranean garage. Use of the parking spaces by existing or new monthly parking permit employees would potentially increase parking availability within the public parking garages and facilities that are centrally located in the Downtown area. Unlike some monthly parking permits that provide Downtown employees the ability to seek available parking spaces within the Downtown area, employees issued a permit for this specific location could have a dedicated space at the site, which would result in reduced trips in the area.", "Terms of the shared parking agreement, including leasing, parking rate, and permitted hour provisions are further outlined in Section 2.7.21 of the development agreement. Users of the parking spaces could be identified through a future process established by the City with parking spaces charged at public parking rates established by the parking rates resolution adopted by City Council.

This amount was negotiated after extensive discussion regarding the possibility of using greywater for toilet flushing in the project. The use of greywater for toilet flushing has been recently allowed by LA County Department of Public Health, however, the regulatory framework for installing such a system and the maintenance and testing requirements that follow is still in flux. In researching other multi-family residential projects around the country that have installed greywater systems, such projects tended to be on average 250 units, had obtained sizeable grants from a public utility, or were no longer using the greywater system due to maintenance difficulties. In speaking with manufacturers of greywater systems, it became clear that the cost of maintenance and regulatory compliance due to water testing could be substantial. Further, the City has not yet developed a regulatory framework that would provide appropriate oversight for testing of greywater systems. Given the uncertainty in ensuring the long-term success of a greywater system in the project, staff ultimately decided that a contribution that represented what it would cost to install a greywater system would be more effective in bringing the use of greywater in the City to fruition. The contribution could assist the City in studying the feasibility of greywater systems and also be a source of potential grants for partners who are interested in pilot projects for greywater systems.", "Bioswales", "Bioswales are landscape elements that allow for the collection, conveyance, filtration and infiltration of stormwater, in efforts to reduce contaminated stormwater runoff. In addition to satisfying the on-site stormwater requirements for the project, the developer would design and construct a bioswale within the public right-of-way/sidewalk immediately adjacent to Lincoln Boulevard. The bioswale would capture, treat, and infiltrate the first \u00be\u201d of contaminated stormwater runoff from Lincoln Boulevard. In efforts to prevent stormwater from percolating into the soils directly below the bioswale/sidewalk area, in proximity to the project\u2019s basement walls that may impact the building\u2019s structural integrity, water runoff would be captured at the bioswale, then piped to a deep percolation well underneath the center of Lincoln Boulevard. This design has been developed and evaluated in coordination with the City\u2019s Public Works Department. The City would be responsible for periodic well maintenance once constructed by the developer.", "The developer would perform soil/percolation tests to study soil conditions at the location for adequate percolation.

Staff agrees that the primary reason for installation of batteries is for back-up of mission critical systems in a building. They are also used in building systems to reduce the cost of electricity loads during peak demand times, a process called \u201cpeak shaving\u201d. Although peak shaving relieves pressure on the grid during peak demand times, it is unclear if this should be considered an environmental community benefit. The excess solar energy produced during non-peak times would feed the grid in the absence of batteries.

For this project, the baseline project was defined as a Tier 1 project with a base height of 32 feet and 1.5 FAR, pursuant to the Mixed-Use Boulevard zoning designation. To quantify the amount of this value enhancement, the City\u2019s financial consultant, KMA, independently prepared a pro forma analyses, and estimated the difference in residual land values (estimated value less estimated construction costs) for the baseline project and the Proposed Project.

These include two City projects (4th/5th and Arizona and the 4th Street Arclight Cinema), four hotel projects and 16 mixed-use residential projects. Of the 16 pending mixed-use projects, six are not being negotiated at this time either because they do not meet the priority processing standards established by the City Council or the applicant has not actively pursued approval of the project.", "It is anticipated that the DSP would include provisions similar to the Zoning Ordinance for Tier 2 projects within the plan area and would also include a non-negotiated Development Review permit process for Tier 3 mixed-use housing projects up to a certain size, to be determined in the DSP. Such Tier 3 projects would require an enhanced, but prescribed package of community benefits in the form of additional affordable housing and impact fees, above and beyond what would be required for Tier 2 projects.", "Until the DSP is adopted, it cannot be determined how many of the pending projects would be subject to either a Tier 2 or a Tier 3 Development Review permit. However, staff anticipates that, as currently proposed, some projects would be processed through a Development Review permit, and others may be redesigned or reduced in size in order to fall within the Development Review permit standards and therefore avoid the Development Agreement process. Unlike the remainder of the City in which Tier 3 projects generally must be processed by a Development Agreement under the LUCE, no such limitation applies in the Downtown Core. Thus, whether and the extent to which these projects should be processed by Development Agreement or through some other mechanism is a Council policy determination, subject to the legal considerations described later in this report.", "Gateway Access Master Plan", "The scope of the DSP covers the entire area described in the LUCE as the Downtown District. While the majority of the Downtown area consists of a regular grid street pattern, well integrated into the rest of the City, the southern portion of the area, between Colorado and the freeway, consists of irregular parcels that were created when the interstate freeway was constructed in the early 1960\u2019s.", "The scar left by freeway construction has imposed a wide, noisy and unsightly barrier between the historic Downtown and the Civic Center. The design of the 4th/5th Street Freeway off-ramp has created a congested bottleneck that frequently backs up onto the Freeway itself and creates a dangerous and unfriendly snarl of traffic at the gateway to both our Downtown and Civic Center. In recent years, various ideas have been envisioned and proposed for redesigning this dysfunctional access, including the potential for decking over the Freeway and/or building a flyway that would allow southbound traffic to connect directly with Olympic Drive. There is also the potential for creating new peripheral parking that would lessen Downtown traffic congestion from both Santa Monica\u2019s visitors and Downtown workforce.", "Because of the unique configuration of this area and the access challenges created by the proximity to the freeway, staff is recommending the creation of an \u201cAccess Gateway\u201d master plan in order to assess the unique issues and site configurations. This focus on this key gateway to Downtown would be based on the overall principles in the Downtown Specific Plan and would be incorporated into that framework upon completion.", "A comprehensive examination of the access issues, development potential and community benefits of future development of this area will allow for the consideration of major infrastructure improvements including the capping of a portion of the freeway and reconfiguration of the 4th Street freeway off-ramp. As currently envisioned, the master plan area would include the three properties bordered by Colorado Avenue on the north, the freeway on the south, 5th Street on the east and Ocean Avenue on the west. There is currently a Development Agreement application pending for the Wyndham Hotel property, and staff has had recent discussions with the owner of the Sears property regarding potential redevelopment of the portion of the site surrounding the historic Sears building. The third site within the boundaries of the plan area is the City owned TOD site adjacent to the Expo line terminus station. In keeping with the principles outlined in this report, a comprehensive approach to public planning of future infrastructure investment and appropriate development standards is preferable to project by project consideration of individual parcels.", "Recommended Approach to Development Agreement Processing", "Even with the Tier 2 processing standards contained in the Zoning Ordinance and the anticipated Development Review permit with standardized community benefits anticipated in the DSP, some projects would still be processed through a Development Agreement. Staff is recommending that the City establish a more predictable package of community benefits for mixed-use housing Development Agreement projects in order to provide transparency and certainty in the process. The list of community benefits would include a higher amount of affordable housing and increased impact fees. However, the scope of this effort must be guided by legal principles.", "Development Agreements are individually negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Subject to consistency with the general plan, the City has broad discretion in determining whether to enter into a Development Agreement and the terms of that Development Agreement. The determination of the appropriate package/range of community benefits is similarly established on a case-by case basis. The assessment of appropriate level of community benefits has varied and been dependent on such factors as the nature and type project, level of development, its location, identified community needs, and whether the benefits are provided by other Development Agreements (to avoid undesired duplication).", "Because these agreements are the result of voluntary negotiations between the City and a developer, any exaction of a monetary or property interest as part of these agreements is not subject to the legal standard established in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission and Dolan v. City of Tigard. Under Nollan and Dolan, the government may condition the grant of a land use permit on the property owner\u2019s provision of an exaction only when the government demonstrates that there is an \u201cessential nexus\u201d and \u201crough proportionality\u201d between the required exaction and the projected impact of the proposed land use. Thus, community benefits which are individually negotiated as part of a Development Agreement would not need to meet heightened scrutiny even if characterized as an exaction. However, Nollan/Dolan would be implicated if the City were to establish fixed exactions that had to be part of each Development Agreement and were not subject to individual negotiation. Consequently, if the community benefits were characterized as exactions, the City would have to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between both the intended use and amount to the deleterious public impact of the development.", "In general, an exaction involves divesting a developer of either money or a possessory interest in property. Examples of exactions include development fees, dedications (transfer of an interest in real property to a public entity for the public\u2019s use), and required expenditures for onsite or off-site public improvements. In contrast, land use regulations such as use restrictions, on-site affordable housing, open space provisions (not dedicated to public use), design features, aesthetic regulations, and general development standards (e.g., height, FAR, number of stories) are not exactions and are subject to a very deferential standard of review. Uniformity in land use regulations would not raise the same legal concern, although it could result in a reduction in the City\u2019s discretion over the project, particularly if it is a housing project.", "While every Development Agreement that the City has processed since 2013 has been individually negotiated, recently concluded Development Agreement negotiations between staff and the respective applicants have resulted in community benefit packages that are similar in the range of the benefits provided. Variations in community benefits have largely reflected the relative size of the proposed developments and the type of uses contemplated. The range of benefits negotiated for these recent projects include an increased amount of affordable housing with the majority of the units at 50% AMI, affordable housing availability for disabled households, increased open space, reserved public parking, community meeting space, local hiring, a high level of environmentally sustainable design, enhanced impact fees, aggressive transportation demand management strategies and monetary contributions to early childhood initiatives, historic preservation and the Big Blue Bus. Some of these benefits would be characterized as exactions and others as land use regulations.", "Staff anticipates following a similar approach in standardizing the community benefit packages for future Development Agreements in order to simplify the process to the extent possible and to provide transparency in the Development Agreement negotiation process. With Council direction, staff would establish a proposed list of community benefits, obtain Planning Commission input on the proposed list, and return to Council in early 2016 with a recommended package of community benefits.", "Pending Development Agreement Applications", "There are currently 28 Development Agreement applications that have been filed Citywide. Of the 28 pending applications, ten are not presently being actively processed, either because they do not meet the priority processing guidelines established by the City Council or the applicant has not pursued approval of the application, which leaves 18 \u201cactive\u201d pending Development Agreement projects.", "Since the completion of its review of the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission has reviewed and recommended approval of three mixed-use housing projects including 1415 5th Street, 1560 Lincoln (Dennys site) and 1601 Lincoln (Norms site). Two of these projects are scheduled for City Council review on October 13th and the other one (Norms) is scheduled for City Council on December 8th. Only one other Development Agreement project is likely to come before the City Council before the adoption of the DSP: 500 Broadway, a mixed-use housing project has been pending for several years and has a draft EIR currently out for public review.", "Staff will continue to process Development Review permits for pending mixed-use housing projects. These include a 27 unit project at 3008 Santa Monica Blvd. that recently converted from a Development Agreement application to a Development Review permit application and a 100% affordable project at 1626 Lincoln Blvd.", "Staff also recommends that the City continue to actively process four City-related projects including two mixed use projects that are primarily housing and are involved in the land acquisition for the fire station #1 on 7th Street. The other two are the proposed 4th Street Arclight Cinema project and the proposed 4th and 5th and Arizona project. However, none of these are likely to come before Council prior to the completion of the DSP and in both cases the City controls the underlying land.", "Following the adoption of the DSP, staff will review the remaining pending applications and assess their compliance with the adopted plan.

Furthermore, staff believes that allowing direct access to the basement level from the street level would provide a pedestrian-oriented entry and promote activity along the sidewalk, improving the walkability along the mid-block portion of Ocean Avenue. Specifically, south of the property along Ocean Avenue, between the Hotel and Broadway, the street lacks active ground-floor pedestrian-oriented uses.", "In imposing the restriction, the Planning Commission expressed concerns regarding potential noise generated by restaurant patrons utilizing the external stairs, and particularly with patrons queuing within the stairwell.

The Georgian believes the standard alcohol-related condition that was imposed is more appropriate for a standalone restaurant not associated with a hotel. Furthermore, the appellant states that pedestrians walking along Ocean Avenue may wish to visit the hotel and lounge on the veranda and be served an alcoholic beverage without ordering a meal. The Georgian Hotel does not intend to operate a bar area in which only alcohol service is available, and food would be available in all areas during all hours when alcohol is available, pursuant to other recommended alcohol conditions.", "In further support for this requested change, the Georgian states that there are alcohol Conditional Use Permits for other hotels in the downtown area and along Ocean Avenue that do not include the subject condition, and that other hotels, such as the Viceroy Hotel, only have a condition that food or meals be available during alcohol service hours, and do not include a requirement that alcohol cannot be served unless patrons intend to order food. Other hotels within the area where alcohol service is currently regulated by a CUP include the Shore Hotel, Loews, Shangri-La, and Casa Del Mar. Of these existing establishments, the Shore Hotel and Loews requires that patrons must be either seated or waiting to be seated for meal service in order to be served alcohol. Alcohol service within the Le Merigot, and Le Meridien Delfina hotels are currently not regulated by a CUP. Therefore, these hotels may serve alcoholic beverages to patrons who do not intend to purchase a meal. Staff notes that the CUP\u2019s with less stringent regulation were issued some years ago. The City\u2019s regulatory approach has evolved, particularly in light of increased problems associated with establishments serving alcohol.", "However, in reviewing the Georgian\u2019s request, staff agrees that hotels with ancillary restaurants are different in nature from standalone restaurants and based on the hotel setting and operation, it may be appropriate with careful regulation to allow a patron to be served an alcoholic beverage without meal service. However, staff remains concerned that allowing the service of alcohol without meals could still promote the conversion of a portion of the hotel establishment into a bar. To address this matter while recognizing the unique nature of hotel operations, Staff recommends Condition 15 which would allow patrons to be served a maximum of two alcoholic beverages without ordering food. This condition would enable the Georgian to meet its stated objective of offering its guests alcohol while they wait for check-in or before departing for dinner or other activities, but would aid in preventing the hotel from turning into a drinking destination for the general public.  This revised condition would apply to the lobby and veranda areas only. Furthermore, Conditions No. 12, 14, 18, and 19 ensure that food service would be available and that all patrons would have the ability to purchase food concurrent with alcohol service. As an alternative to this proposal, staff considered allowing only hotel patrons and their guests (excluding public patrons) to be served a maximum of two alcoholic beverages without ordering food. However, staff believes differentiating hotel patrons and their guests from public patrons would be difficult for the hotel to administer and for the City to enforce.", "As a result of modifying Condition 14, the Georgian also requests new and revised language as provided in their appeal statement, resulting in conditions 11, 15, and 19.

Unite Here\u2019s complete statement is provided as Attachment C.", "Alleged Georgian Hotel Operation Violations", "Unite Here claims the Georgian is not in compliance with its existing CUP. Unite Here states that the Planning Commission staff report was unclear on the amount of food and alcohol service allowed within the lobby and veranda, and suggests that there are expanded areas that are currently being used for restaurant service. To clarify, there are two separate dining areas consisting of a 267 SF portion of the lobby area and the 477 SF veranda dining area, totaling 744 SF of permissible dining area open to the public pursuant to the current CUP 08-014. Unite Here argues that it would be inappropriate to allow the hotel to amend their CUP, claiming that the Hotel may be violating the terms of its existing CUP. However, staff has no evidence of these alleged violations. More specifically, there have been no code compliance cases to date investigating improper seating arrangements or CUP/alcohol-related violations. Unite Here also describes typical average space per dining seat to support a suggestion that the Hotel will add more seats in dining areas, such as the lobby area, than the Hotel is permitted to provide. However, if the Council approves the requested CUP, it will establish the exact number and location of the seating in the lobby and veranda, the violation of which will be subject to Code enforcement.", "Parking Variance: Impacts on Traffic and Parking", "Unite Here expresses concerns regarding traffic and parking, contending that the parking requirements are underestimated, since a parking ratio of 1 space per 50 SF of bar area and 1 space per 300 SF per kitchen support area were not factored into the parking calculation. However parking requirements were calculated correctly since bar area parking ratios are only applied to standalone bars or bars that are physically separated from the primary dining area. The Georgian does not propose such areas. Furthermore, the bar seats would function the same as table seats where meal service would be available during all alcohol service hours. The existing kitchen facility in the basement is not subject to additional parking requirements as the space would not generate any additional parking since it currently provides food service to the existing restaurant.", "Unite Here also questions the exclusion of the middle portion of the lobby area from the restaurant parking calculations and also states that the hotel would utilize the space contrary to their approval. As discussed, staff does not support the Georgian\u2019s request to utilize the entire lobby area for a dining area and recommends that the middle portion of the lobby remain open and accessible for hotel patrons accessing the building. Since this area does not include seating, staff does not support authorizing patrons standing within this area the ability to consume food or alcoholic beverages. Allowing the use of this space in this manner would aid in the conversion of this space to more of a bar-like atmosphere. Accordingly, if the staff recommendation is accepted, this area would not be included in the parking calculation. In contrast, if Council were to accept the Georgian\u2019s request, the number of required parking spaces would need to be increased to 31 and the off-site parking requirement would need to be increased accordingly.", "To ensure that this portion of the lobby is not utilized as dining, staff recommends Condition 15 that would prohibit food or alcohol service to standing patrons within the lobby, and Condition 49 that would require that restaurant seating areas be in accordance with the approved plans. Accordingly, the parking calculation would be as follows:", "Expanded Lobby Area Dining: 550 SF @ 1 space per 75 SF = 7.3", "Basement Level Dining Area: 1,397 SF @ 1 space per 75 SF = +18.6", "25.9 (rounded to", "26 spaces)", "Unite Here also believes the parking variance and total number of parking spaces provided is insufficient based on current parking requirements. The Georgian currently has a parking variance which requires that 35 spaces be provided on-site with a specified TDM measure and valet service condition. The Georgian is operating in accordance with these requirements. The requested parking variance at issue only concerns the additional parking that is required due to the Georgian\u2019s requested change and expansion in the operation of the restaurant facilities.", "In review of the requested parking variance, staff believes a hybrid approach of leasing additional off-site parking spaces and implementing a comprehensive Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program is warranted. Accordingly, staff recommends Condition 39 to require the applicant secure a minimum of 15 additional off-site parking spaces in lieu of the 26 on-site required spaces. The condition would include a minimum 12-month term for lease agreements, and the off-site spaces must commence within 300-feet of the subject property and be located within a 1,000-foot perimeter. Alternatively, through a Shared Parking Permit pursuant to the City\u2019s Interim Zoning Ordinance No. 2490 (CCS) (\u201cIZO\u201d), parking could be located anywhere in the Downtown Core. To ensure the maximum use of the hotel\u2019s on-site parking and to facilitate overflow parking to the 15 off-site parking spaces, Condition 38 requires that the existing valet attendant parking service be available to both hotel and restaurant patrons.", "Unite Here believes this off-site parking requirement is not adequate, and states that these 15 parking spaces would not be considered \u201cnew\u201d spaces within the downtown, thereby further exacerbating parking and traffic since the project would not increase the downtown parking supply. However, staff believes the use of underutilized parking in the Downtown area should be encouraged through shared parking arrangements. Building additional parking for the project as suggested by Unite Here would be contrary to the City\u2019s goals of utilizing existing parking supply through shared parking arrangements and reducing parking demand through the implementation of TDM strategies that would further address additional parking demand.", "Staff believes a waiver of the requirement for the remaining 11 parking spaces is warranted based on implementation of a TDM program, the Georgian\u2019s documented employee transit usage to the workplace, and the project\u2019s location in the Downtown. The TDM program (see Condition 35) would include, but not limited to, employee transit passes and parking cash out, a customer incentive program, and complementary bike valet service to incentivize employees and restaurant patrons to consider alternate modes of transit to the site other than single occupancy vehicles. Several of these measures have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the use of single-occupancy vehicle to the workplace.", "The hotel\u2019s recent annual employee trip reduction plans indicate an Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR) of 2.16 (am/pm average) where approximately 59% of hotel employees utilize non-single occupancy vehicle transportation to the workplace, which is higher than the 40% city average, and higher than the hotel\u2019s previous year of 50%. Therefore, it is anticipated that employee parking demand would not considerably increase even if additional staff were required. However, the Georgian states that additional staff will not be needed, since it intends to extend shift hours to accommodate expanded service.", "Unite Here provides estimates of the number of potential hotel and non-hotel customers who would visit the restaurant per day, and states that the restaurant would eventually primarily serve non-hotel patrons, resulting in a higher parking demand than the parking variance could accommodate. The Georgian states that approximately 70% of current restaurant patrons consist of hotel patrons and 30% consists of the general public. Staff acknowledges that although the percentage of public use could increase based on the additional restaurant seats or having an independent restaurant in the basement area, hotel restaurants typically consist of a mix of hotel patrons and the general public. Therefore a lower public parking demand generated by the public for restaurant service may translate to a lower parking requirement. However because data has not been provided that substantiates the hotel\u2019s restaurant patron mix statement, staff has not utilized this information in discounting the parking requirement.", "Finally, the Downtown is a highly successful \u201cPark Once-Pedestrian First\u201d district consisting of a shared parking supply and multi-modal transit system. Even when individuals choose to drive, they can park their vehicle at a central location at the beginning of their trip, walk to multiple destinations, and return to their vehicle just before they leave the area, thereby reducing the need for driving. Based on the hotel\u2019s location within this district, it is anticipated that restaurant patrons will visit other commercial uses in the area, and utilize transit or nearby public parking facilities within the nearby downtown area, resulting in a lower on-site parking demand.", "Unite Here also questions the utilization of two existing parking spaces for valet bike parking, as outlined in the TDM bike valet provision. The use of two vehicular parking spaces could provide up to twenty bike parking spaces. Valet bike parking service for customers at this location would further City goals in encouraging local residents to utilize bicycles to sites located along Ocean Avenue and the overall downtown area. However, staff concurs that provision of a bike valet should not be at the expense of already limited parking. Staff proposes revising this provision to provide that in the event the hotel utilizes on-site vehicular parking spaces to accommodate bike valet parking demand (2 space maximum), then an equal number of new parking spaces must be provided off-site in accordance with Condition 39 (off-site parking requirement).", "Coastal Access for Persons of Low to Moderate Income", "Unite Here states that the Georgian is an existing hotel that is \u201cout of market\u201d for persons of low-to-moderate income levels, and states that the approved requests increase the inability for persons of low-to-moderate income to access the hotel (and therefore the coastal area). Unite Here refers to the Coastal Act and states Coastal Commission responsibilities to protect and provide lower-cost overnight accommodations as required by the Coastal Act (Section 30213 referenced). The City implements the requirements of the Coastal Act through Policy 35 of the City\u2019s Local Coastal Program and Ordinance Number 1516 (CCS). However, since the Georgian Hotel is not affordable lodging and is not removing any affordable lodging, it is therefore not subject to these provisions.", "Alcohol Permit Saturation", "Unite Here contends that the action, findings, and conditions of approval do not sufficiently mitigate the impacts (including environmental impacts) associated with the Conditional Use Permit and Parking Variance on the community in terms of alcohol permit saturation.", "The Police Department has not indicated any alcohol-related issues or concerns regarding the restaurant\u2019s operations since food and alcohol service to the public commenced in 2009, and no alcohol-related code compliance cases have been filed by the City during this time. Updated alcohol-related conditions of approval have been added to the existing CUP 08CUP-014 conditions to further minimize potential impacts associated with on-site alcohol consumption and to ensure the restaurant will not adversely affect the welfare of neighborhood residents. The proposed CUP amendments will not contribute to an undue concentration of alcohol outlets in the area in that the restaurant currently has an existing alcohol license that permits alcohol sales to hotel patrons and the general public, and therefore will not increase the number of alcohol serving establishments in the District.", "Community Outreach", "Downtown Santa Monica Inc. had been notified of the project and did not have comments or objections to the request for alcohol as proposed by the applicant.", "Alternatives", "As an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may consider the following with respect to the pending appeals if supported by the full evidentiary record:", "1.

The Los Angeles City Council adopted a minimum wage ordinance at its June 10, 2015 meeting. The Santa Monica City Council directed staff to review the Los Angeles proposed ordinance and its potential impact on Santa Monica, including the possibility of passing a similar ordinance, in September 2014 and again in June 2015 following the Los Angeles ordinance adoption. Staff coordinated meetings for the Santa Monica business and nonprofit communities to discuss a minimum wage increase. At these meetings, experts in minimum wage economic impacts who analyzed the Los Angeles proposal made presentations on these results and discussed, at a broad level, implications for Santa Monica. Staff recorded concerns raised by the individuals who attended outreach meetings, and experts clarified information through the outreach process. Staff recommends the Council adopt the proposed ordinance increasing the minimum wage in the City of Santa Monica, based on the Los Angeles legislation, and including Council direction for service charges and union supersession. The result would be a phased increase, starting at $10.50 per hour on July 1, 2016 and reaching $15 per hour by July 1, 2020 for most businesses. Staff recommends returning to Council with modifications related to paid leave and enforcement, and seeks further Council direction for a hotel worker minimum wage and a seasonal workers exemption.", "Background", "On August 25, 2015, the City Council unanimously supported preserving Santa Monica as an inclusive and affordable community as one of the City\u2019s top three Priority Strategic Goals. One aspect of affordability is the cost of housing. Another is the ability of low-wage workers to afford the rising cost of housing in Santa Monica.", "The primary goal of raising the minimum wage is to increase the pay of low wage workers at a time when their share of overall income has declined and the cost of housing has risen faster than inflation. Economic research literature agrees that minimum wage laws achieve this goal, and consistently finds that the affected workers are mostly adults, and disproportionately women and people of color. In addition to the immediate benefits of increased income, research literature suggests longer-term benefits in improved health outcomes for workers and children, and in increases in children\u2019s school achievement and cognitive and behavioral outcomes. The nation as a whole and specific regions have historically prospered when the benefits of economic growth are widely shared.", "Since Measure JJ, a proposed living wage measure, lost by a narrow margin in 2002, the Santa Monica community has supported minimum wage rules for those employed in the City. Effective July 1, 2005, Council approved a living wage requirement for any contractor providing services to the City of Santa Monica pursuant to a contract in the amount of $54,200 or greater. This living wage, currently $15.37 per hour, is also included in the development agreements for three upcoming hotels.", "At its September 9, 2014 meeting (Attachment A), the Council directed staff to monitor Mayor Garcetti's proposal to raise the minimum wage in the City of Los Angeles and to analyze the effect that raising the minimum wage in Los Angeles would have on the City of Santa Monica. Council further directed staff to place a discussion regarding the possibility of raising the minimum wage in Santa Monica on the Council agenda, in the event that the City of Los Angeles implemented the minimum wage increase.", "The Los Angeles City Council approved its minimum wage ordinance on June 10, 2015. On June 5, 2015 (Attachment B), staff submitted an informational report to the Council on the ordinance, and informed Council of plans to move forward with a study estimating impacts of a similar increase in Santa Monica. At its June 9, 2015 meeting (Attachment C), Council discussed the Los Angeles minimum wage increase and directed staff to initiate community outreach and begin preparation of an ordinance setting a minimum wage and other minimum terms for Santa Monica employers. Council further recommended that staff contract with researchers from the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment (IRLE) to conduct outreach with the community. The IRLE has provided analysis for minimum wage increases in many California and other U.S. cities, and a peer review of several studies related to the Los Angeles minimum wage cited the IRLE report as the best supported and most reasonable assessment of the law\u2019s economic impact.", "Discussion", "As a smaller city sharing borders with the City of Los Angeles, Santa Monica coordinates with Los Angeles on many policy issues, and is an active partner in the greater Los Angeles economy. Staff\u2019s recommendation is to match the City of Los Angeles minimum wage policy on a broad level. Doing so would promote fairness, provide regional wage equality, decrease market distortions, and facilitate implementation and compliance.", "The data necessary to perform an in-depth, City-level economic analysis of a minimum wage increase in Santa Monica is not readily available apart from Census data, quarterly labor market reports and annual Transportation Demand Management (TDM) surveys, all of which report summary data. This data is insufficient for a reliable in-depth analysis. However, available Santa Monica business and economic data, when compared to the same values for Los Angeles, provide some indication of how Santa Monica and its businesses may respond to a minimum wage increase.", "The draft Santa Monica ordinance matches the Los Angeles wage levels and schedule, and its exceptions for small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and youth learners. It differs from the Los Angeles ordinance in areas where Los Angeles has not yet come to a decision, and where Council has provided specific direction: union supersession, service charges, and transitional jobs programs.", "Staff recommends providing for union supersession, which is consistent with the City\u2019s living wage and provides flexibility for employers of employees represented by a valid collective bargaining agreement. In response to Council direction given on June 9, 2015, staff recommends language that requires service charges to be spent on employees providing the service. Based on Los Angeles direction and consistent with community needs, staff recommends a limited transitional jobs program exemption, to be reviewed and revised as necessary following final Los Angeles language. Staff recommends returning to Council with further direction on paid leave and enforcement, pending more research and information.", "Finally, staff recommends the Council authorize conducting research and outreach for pursuing a hotel minimum wage increase that would mirror the Los Angeles hotel \u201cliving wage\u201d as well as consideration of a potential transitional exemption for seasonal and trainee workers and any other changes the Council wishes to consider implementing beyond the provisions of the current proposed ordinance", "The Los Angeles Minimum Wage", "The Los Angeles ordinance phases in annual increases to reach $15 per hour by 2020 for most businesses.

An early amendment had directed staff to develop paid time off policies consistent with previous City wage policies, which most understand to translate to 12 paid and 10 unpaid leave days per year. This is the same as the requirements of the hotel worker minimum wage ordinance. Separately, a new State law effective July 1, 2015 mandates at least three paid sick days annually for workers. The Los Angeles City Council removed this item from the ordinance and directed the Chief Legislative Analyst to review other California cities\u2019 sick leave policies and current State law, and return with a recommendation for a sick leave policy for all employees working in the City of Los Angeles. This item is still pending.", "\u00b7 Service charges. An early amendment directed staff to ensure consistency with the City\u2019s hotel worker minimum wage related to service charges.

The first year also includes two additional attorney positions to provide legal support and interpretation of the new law, and an additional contract administration position. The full position and allowance target will be phased in over four years as the number of employees covered by the wage law increases. The IRLE and other reports stressed the importance of enforcement in realizing the positive benefits projected with a minimum wage increase.", "The ordinance requires a study every three years starting July 1, 2016 to review the state of the City's economy, based on data currently collected, and requires annual collection of economic data, including jobs, earnings and sales tax revenue.", "Projected Impacts in Los Angeles", "The Los Angeles City Council\u2019s Economic Development Committee (LAEDC) selected the UC Berkeley IRLE to provide an analysis of the projected impact of a minimum wage increase as originally proposed by the Mayor and expanded on by the LAEDC: reaching $13.25 by 2017 and $15.25 by 2019. The study assessed the economic impact of the proposal on workers, businesses and the city\u2019s economy, and analyzed policy design options. While the progression of the increases studied in the report was more aggressive than the adopted wage progression, the results are still indicative of potential impacts of the final proposal, with a longer phase-in and lower ultimate target.", "The study concluded that positive impacts in income gains to low income residents and regional economic growth would largely outweigh any potential decreases to city economic growth, marginal job losses and slight increases to business operating costs. This is in part due to the benefits produced by a higher wage, such as reduced employee turnover and improved performance offsetting some of the labor cost increases, and increased consumer demand from wage increases offsetting declines in sales from higher prices. Analysis indicates that the benefits from reduced employee turnover and increased performance would apply equally to nonprofit organizations, and would also lead to increased quality of care for service recipients. However, certain types of nonprofits and those relying significantly on government reimbursement rates would benefit from a longer phase-in period. For all covered groups, researchers recommended strong monitoring and a focus on enforcement.", "Major points from study conclusions include:", "\u00b7 Many low wage workers will benefit. By 2019, over 40% of workers, about 609,000 individuals, would receive a pay increase associated with the minimum wage change.", "\u00b7 Business operating costs will not change significantly. Across all industries, the minimum wage increase would translate to a 0.9% increase in operating costs. This is a very small impact given the wage change from $9 per hour to $15.25 per hour is a 67% increase. This includes the cost increases necessary to maintain salary level distinctions (i.e. supervisors would require a wage increase to remain at a level higher than their subordinates). Operating costs differ by industry with restaurants affected most at an estimated 7.8% increase in costs.", "\u00b7 Economic growth will not be strongly affected. The wage increase would have very little economic impact in either a positive or negative direction. Projections for Los Angeles city are a 0.1% decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) versus a scenario with no increase; for Los Angeles County this number changes to a 0.1% GDP increase.", "\u00b7 Some industries will have a harder adjustment. Minimum wage workers are concentrated in a few industries that would be more affected than others. Food services, with 17.3% of minimum wage workers, and among the highest percentage of industry workers receiving an increase at over 75%, would be most impacted.", "\u00b7 Small firms will be most impacted. Smaller firms tend to have a larger percentage of low wage workers than larger firms; the study estimates that for businesses with 99 or fewer employees, 50% or more of their employees will receive a raise associated with the minimum wage increase, this number drops to about 40% for firms with 100 to 499 workers, and to 35% for firms with more than 500 workers.", "\u00b7 Nonprofit organizations have specific challenges. In Los Angeles, the share of nonprofit workers projected to receive wage increases is substantially lower than in the private sector, at 30.4% compared to 45.2%. However, average nonprofit labor costs represent about 38% of operating costs, compared to 22% in the private sector, so an increase in labor costs would affect a nonprofit organization more. And, unlike the private sector, which may pass through operating cost increases to customers, nonprofit funding comes from a variety of sources \u2013 program revenues, private donations, and government funding \u2013 that organizations cannot control or manage to the same extent.", "\u00b7 Nonprofit impacts are concentrated in childcare and residential care. The nonprofit sector varies widely, from large hospitals and universities to childcare, religious, and civic organizations. Within these categories, the majority of low wage workers are centered in residential care facilities and childcare services, where more than half of workers would receive wage increases (62.0% and 58.9%, respectively), compared to just 13.6% for hospital workers, who make up the largest segment of nonprofit workers. Similarly, these types of organizations will experience the greatest payroll cost increases, at an estimated 8.1% for childcare and 7.0% for residential care by 2019.", "\u00b7 Nonprofits dependent on government funding sources may need assistance. The Los Angeles report cites organizations providing services to people with developmental disabilities and those in early childcare and education as the most impacted. California law guarantees a system of comprehensive support services to people with developmental disabilities and sets reimbursement rates. These rates have been largely frozen since 2003-2004, and organizations are unable to recoup cost increases by charging clients above reimbursement rates due to State law; so that private fundraising is the only option to avoid service cuts. In childcare and early education, the State subsidy rates have also not kept pace with inflationary increases. In this area, low-income consumers have limited ability to pay higher costs.", "Projected Impacts in Santa Monica", "Staff engaged Dr. Michael Reich and Ken Jacobs of the IRLE to assist with community outreach and provide perspective on a Santa Monica increase based on the Los Angeles analysis.", "While the Santa Monica and Los Angeles local economies are dissimilar in many ways, there are sufficient similarities to suggest that the analysis conducted for Los Angeles would provide insight into the wage increase\u2019s potential impact on Santa Monica\u2019s economy.", "In 2014, average total employment in Santa Monica was about 86,000, with an average 9,253 establishments. About 62% of total employment is in five sectors: accommodation and food services (16.1%); professional, scientific, and technical services (12.7%); health care and social assistance (11.3%); information (11.4%); and retail trade (10.7%). The largest contributors to average payroll, making up 40.6%, are information (23.0%) and professional, scientific and technical services (17.7%). In Santa Monica, businesses with fewer than 100 employees make up 67% of total City employment[1].", "According to the 2014 labor market data, the accommodations and food services sector employs approximately 14,000 people in a total of 429 establishments. The majority of the jobs in this sector are in restaurants. Food services and drinking places make up 78% of the sector\u2019s employees (11,000 employees) and have a smaller payroll per employee, with 69% average contribution to payroll. With a large percentage of total employment and relatively low contribution to total payroll (5.3%), food services and accommodations is both a significant part of Santa Monica\u2019s workforce, and one with lower wages.", "As of 2014, Santa Monica had 307 public charities, with 56% in three categories: human services (24.1%); arts, culture and humanities (18.6%); and education other than higher education (13.7%)[2]. This distribution tracks roughly with Los Angeles. Santa Monica has a slightly higher percentage of organizations dedicated to arts and culture, the environment, and higher education, and slightly lower percentages in religion and human services. Santa Monica\u2019s nonprofit organizations are on average larger; even when adjusting overall nonprofit industry revenue data to exclude some outliers such as RAND Corporation, average revenue per organization is substantially above that of Los Angeles, at $10.3 million compared to $2.3 million in Los Angeles.", "Using this information and conclusions drawn from relevant minimum wage research, researchers project that a minimum wage increase in Santa Monica would likely have less impact on employment, prices, and the overall economy than what is estimated for Los Angeles. The following summarizes major points of comparison between the cities and supports staff\u2019s recommendation to adopt a minimum wage ordinance aligned with Los Angeles.", "\u00b7 Size and Scope. Los Angeles is the dominant economic force in the region, and its wage increase will impact Santa Monica\u2019s businesses and labor market even if Santa Monica does not act. Absent any Santa Monica action, businesses and nonprofits will need to increase wages to remain competitive with Los Angeles. Several of Santa Monica\u2019s nonprofit organizations also operate in Los Angeles, where they would be subject to the higher minimum wage rate.", "\u00b7 Industries. The Los Angeles analysis estimates that over half of the workforce affected by the minimum wage is concentrated in four industries, led by food services. A higher percentage of Santa Monica\u2019s private sector employment is in the accommodations and food services industries (17.5%) than in Los Angeles (10.2%). This suggests that a minimum wage increase could potentially have a greater impact on the City\u2019s economy than it would for Los Angeles. However, some Santa Monica specific elements, such as higher average pay rates and substantial tourism, would offset this impact.", "\u00b7 Average weekly pay. Santa Monica businesses already pay higher average wages than Los Angeles employers in the restaurant and accommodations industries. In Santa Monica, the average weekly pay in the accommodations industry is approximately 12% greater than that of LA; in the restaurant industry that difference is 19%. This means that although a greater proportion of Santa Monica\u2019s industries are among the most vulnerable to minimum wage increases, the effect on labor costs will not be as great.", "\u00b7 Tourism. Santa Monica\u2019s economy is more dependent on tourism than that of Los Angeles. Tourism is unlikely to suffer from a Santa Monica minimum wage increase for several reasons:", "\u00a7 A large part of Santa Monica tourism is linked to Los Angeles, so that any change occurring in Los Angeles would impact Santa Monica whether or not the City adopts its own ordinance.", "\u00a7 Tourists are generally less price-sensitive than other consumers; and Santa Monica has a distinct tourist appeal as a beach city, which makes its visitors less price-sensitive than those in Los Angeles.", "\u00a7 Hotels have demonstrated resiliency during the 2008 recession, and Santa Monica continues to have very high hotel occupancy rates, despite being among the highest priced in the region.", "\u00b7 Nonprofits. Santa Monica\u2019s nonprofit organizations will be impacted to varying degrees, based on organizations\u2019 funding sources and services. For example, organizations with interim housing services employing staff around the clock will be impacted at a higher rate than other programs. Childcare organizations are likely to be among those most impacted by the minimum wage increase, as a large percentage of their employees are commonly low wage workers. Santa Monica also has a number of nonprofits providing jobs and training to transitional employees.  Continued support of these nonprofits through the transition to a higher minimum wage would further the City\u2019s strategic initiative goals related to maintaining an inclusive and diverse community, reducing homelessness, and emphasizing Santa Monica as a learning community from Cradle to Career and beyond.", "Community Discussions and Input", "Staff held three sessions for the Santa Monica business and nonprofit communities.", "In the business community meetings, Dr. Michael Reich addressed business owners and managers, answered their questions and clarified the analysis. The meetings took place on August 12 and August 18, 2015. Staff recorded each two hour session, and posted links to the recordings on the City\u2019s website (Attachment E). A total of 39 attendees from 34 businesses and organizations attended the sessions. The majority of attendees were from restaurants and business interest groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Santa Monica Inc., and the Main Street Business Improvement Association. Most attendees acknowledged the need for a coordinated regional approach to the minimum wage, but expressed concern about treatment of tipped workers, timing, and the magnitude of the increase. Other concerns included the ability to stay in business, concern for independent or smaller restaurants, and student seasonal workers. A full list of questions and responses is included as Attachment F.", "Staff made a presentation to the Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Board of Directors at the August 27, 2015 meeting.

In addition to the Los Angeles City ordinance, Los Angeles County is expected to adopt the same minimum wage parameters for the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, where the Board serves as the wage setting entity, and nearby cities including Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Long Beach, and Pasadena are considering similar increases. The proposed Santa Monica ordinance mirrors that of the City of Los Angeles and includes the same conditions and exceptions for youth learners, small businesses, and nonprofit organizations.", "Like the Los Angeles ordinance, the proposed minimum wage law would apply to all private organizations and those not specifically exempted under California labor law. Santa Monica\u2019s living wage, established in 2005, would still apply to City contractors over the established threshold.", "The Santa Monica City Council provided staff with specific direction on two policy issues that differ from the Los Angeles ordinance.", "\u00b7 Collective bargaining. Santa Monica\u2019s Council directed staff to include an exemption for employers whose staff are protected by a collective bargaining agreement. The proposed ordinance includes this requirement. Union supersession is already a condition of Santa Monica\u2019s living wage policy and some development agreements. However, some businesses have expressed concern that including this provision in the minimum wage ordinance could create a competitive disadvantage for nonunion businesses.", "\u00b7 Service charges. According to State law, mandatory service charges may be distributed at the employer\u2019s discretion, while voluntary service charges are the property of employees. Santa Monica\u2019s Council directed staff to include language in the ordinance that ensures any service charge remains the property of the staff providing the service. The proposed ordinance includes language to this effect, drawn from the City of Los Angeles Hotel Service Charge Reform Ordinance. This provision does not affect a business owner\u2019s decision to use a service charge, but ensures that the charge is spent on the employees providing the service. However, this is a complex issue and the language from the LA Hotel Ordinance may not achieve the broadest Council objectives. As a result, staff seeks Council direction to work with the business community to identify approaches that provide flexibility in how services charges are distributed to employees, while ensuring that consumers have good information about how services charges are being used. If alternative ordinance language could better achieve the Council\u2019s goals, staff will return with recommendations.", "The draft ordinance includes a limited exemption for transitional job programs, based on Los Angeles direction and consistent with community needs. Staff will review the final language in the Los Angeles ordinance once it is adopted, and return with updates to match this language if appropriate.", "The draft ordinance is included as Attachment G.", "Enforcement and Reporting", "State law governs minimum wage in Santa Monica, including posting requirements. Staff currently follows complaint-based enforcement for the State minimum wage, and can withhold or revoke business licenses as a tool to deal with noncompliant businesses per the municipal code. Staff recommends continuing these practices for the City minimum wage, and complementing enforcement with communication and outreach about the change to residents and employees. Based on other cities\u2019 approaches, staff proposes working through existing community partners to communicate the wage increase and build consumer support for local businesses as they work to manage associated labor cost increases. Enforcement of the minimum wage law, with its various implementation dates and exceptions, would be complicated and could therefore be labor intensive and require substantial additional resources. Even a complaint-based structure would require audits and an eventual legal process.", "Forming a wage enforcement division, as the larger cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles have done, could bring significant long term costs in personnel, in addition to any added legal costs. Staff will explore these costs, and costs associated with other options like regional enforcement, potentially more suited for a smaller city, and will return to Council with a detailed plan for enforcement prior to the ordinance taking effect.", "Staff would monitor business license and sales tax revenue to look for any impact on business health. Staff would include this information in regular biannual financial status updates to Council. Staff would continue to work with the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations supporting businesses in the community, and would engage with the City\u2019s human services and arts grantees to assess ongoing impacts for nonprofit organizations.", "City Support and Advocacy", "Staff will research other city methods and work with partners to explore ways that the City can support Santa Monica\u2019s business and nonprofit communities through this policy change.", "On the business side, staff would continue to partner with the Chamber of Commerce, business improvement districts (BIDs), the Buy Local and Santa Monica Alliance and Santa Monica Travel and Tourism bureau to assist with communication. The Library is also evaluating taking a more active role in having information/messaging tailored to small businesses.", "For nonprofits, City staff can assist with communication, and partner with other cities and nonprofit organizations to advocate at the County, State, and federal levels for funding changes. Again, staff will research other cities\u2019 best practices and make recommendations to Council. For example, San Francisco has implemented a city task force to work with nonprofits on contracting issues, including incorporating cost-of-living provisions into their contracts, and has created a compensation program to help support those childcare organizations serving low income families that are affected by wage-related cost increases.", "Wage Law Recommendations and Further Considerations", "The Los Angeles ordinance contains a small number of exceptions to the minimum wage law. These represent deferrals for certain businesses and nonprofits, and exemptions for specific categories of workers working during a limited time period. No organization, apart from public entities not governed by local wage laws, is excluded from compliance with the law. In general, experts who study the minimum wage recommend against specific carve outs. This is because, while potentially serving a specific interest, they can also create loopholes and incentives to encourage organizations to hire subminimum wage workers. Staff recommendations and policy options for further Council discussion are based on this logic.", "Staff recommends consistency with the Los Angeles ordinance. This promotes regional fairness, and makes compliance and enforcement simpler and more effective for businesses and government. Included in the draft Santa Monica ordinance are exceptions for small businesses and some nonprofit organizations, and for limited transitional jobs programs that are in the process of being incorporated into the Los Angeles ordinance.", "Policy Options for Discussion", "There are a number of policy options that have not been incorporated into the draft ordinance pending Council direction and further review. These items are outlined below.", "\u00b7 Hotel Minimum Wage. Council members have expressed support for matching the City of Los Angeles hotel worker \u201cliving wage\u201d ordinance as consistent with the principles underlying matching the minimum wage ordinance for all workers. Staff recommends the Council authorize research and outreach on this proposal. Upon Council direction, staff would return with information about the potential impact of such an action, including timing, how many hotels may be affected, and comparisons between the Los Angeles and Santa Monica hotel industries. Council could also direct staff to prepare an ordinance for Council consideration. The Los Angeles Hotel Worker Minimum Wage Ordinance, adopted in October 2014, sets a living wage of $15.37 for certain hotel workers, with inflation-based increases beginning on July 1, 2017. The ordinance applies to hotels as shown below:", "o 300 or more rooms: July 1, 2015", "o 150 or more rooms: July 1, 2016", "o Airport Hospitality Enhancement Zone (AHEZ) Hotels: July 1, 2015", "The Los Angeles Hotel Worker Minimum Wage Ordinance also includes compensated and uncompensated leave provisions for full-time workers as outlined below:", "o 96 compensated hours per year for sick leave, vacation, or personal necessity", "o 80 additional hours of uncompensated time off for personal or family sick leave after compensated sick leave is exhausted", "The City of Santa Monica\u2019s living wage ordinance, which applies to employees of City contractors with contracts of $54,200 or greater, mandates a living wage of $15.37 per hour. This living wage is also incorporated in development agreements for three hotels scheduled to open in Santa Monica in the next three to five years.", "\u00b7 Seasonal exception. Pacific Park has provided staff with a proposal to delay paying minimum wage to employees for a period not to exceed six months in any 12 month period, provided that the employer also employs at least 50 other workers at or above minimum wage working at least 35 hours per week on average. This exemption could support businesses providing employment to first time workers, and could mitigate the impact on labor costs of the minimum wage increase for organizations with a significant number of seasonal employees. Minimum wage experts suggest that exempting seasonal employees can create an incentive to substitute full time jobs with short term jobs, which is contrary to the goals of the minimum wage increase. Staff has drafted language to implement this provision in the draft ordinance language if that is Council\u2019s direction.", "\u00b7 Paid time off. As discussed above, the Los Angeles City Council has not yet provided direction on paid leave. For the sake of consistency across borders, staff recommends waiting on this item and returning to Council once Los Angeles has reached a decision, and also with a discussion of the potential impact on businesses and workers. As an alternative, Council could provide specific direction before hearing the Los Angeles decision and other considerations. Should Council direct staff to move forward with a specific paid leave policy, staff would recommend research and outreach on this proposal, its impacts and alternatives.", "\u00b7 Enforcement. The draft ordinance includes basic authority to impose penalties, but does not provide a comprehensive enforcement framework. Staff recommends returning to Council with a revised ordinance that would include a detailed enforcement plan suited to community needs. Returning to Council would allow staff additional time to research the most effective structure. Alternately, Council could direct staff to follow a specific plan, such as to create an enforcement division on the model of San Francisco and Los Angeles. This would preclude consideration of other options, like regional enforcement, that could potentially be more efficient.", "Alternatives", "Council could provide alternate direction to staff on any of the ordinance conditions, including wage level, timing, exemptions, adopting the Los Angeles \u201cliving wage\u201d law for hotels or other policy direction. Depending on the scope of such changes, particularly to the basic outlines of wage level and timing, this could exclude benefits to be gained from coordinating with Los Angeles policy, and has the potential to create confusion among businesses, employees, and patrons. As discussed above, Council could choose to exempt or provide waivers for other specific groups or types of businesses. Doing so could provide short-term relief in some areas, but can create incentives that are contrary to minimum wage goals of improving quality of life for low wage individuals. In the nonprofit industry, studies show a strong link between quality jobs and quality care in human services and childcare and early education where there are many low wage jobs. Exempting these organizations, with the goal of maintaining services, can increase turnover and vacancies, leading to service cuts and decreased quality of service. Similarly, exempting seasonal employees from the minimum wage could create an incentive towards short term jobs. Finally, Council could direct staff to prepare a Hotel Minimum Wage ordinance matching that of Los Angeles.", "Financial Impacts & Budget Actions", "There is no immediate financial impact associated with the staff recommendation. However, increasing the City\u2019s minimum wage could impact the City\u2019s expenditures and revenue in a variety of areas. Staff anticipates incurring expenses related to enforcement, including for personnel and communication. The extent of enforcement-related expenses could vary greatly depending on the model selected; staff expects that a standalone enforcement division would require a significant investment, possibly requiring tradeoffs with other programs or services. Nonprofit organization needs may increase as a result of the minimum wage increase, which could impact the City\u2019s human services and arts grantee funding requests. And, there may be some impact to sales, transient occupancy, and other tax revenue related to the recommended policy change.", "Staff would return to Council prior to the ordinance\u2019s July 1, 2016 implementation with an enforcement plan that would include any known budget requests associated with enforcement. Staff would monitor the proposal\u2019s impact on nonprofit organizations, and would return to Council with any budget requests as appropriate.

The options for mobile telecommunications services have changed significantly over the last few years with an increasing amount being provided through prepaid telephony methods such as prepaid wireless airtime cards, prepaid wireless sim cards, and other prepaid options. Prior to the enactment of AB 1717, which takes effect on January 1, 2016, there was no workable process for collecting and remitting local jurisdictions\u2019 UUT for transactions involving the sale of prepaid telephony services at retail stores. AB 1717 establishes a process for collection at the State level and apportionment to local jurisdictions in the same manner that local sales taxes are collected and remitted.", "Discussion", "Traditionally, a city\u2019s UUT on telephony services is collected by telephone service providers who include the charge on their customers\u2019 monthly invoices. The City\u2019s UUT ordinance specifically includes prepaid services in the list of telecommunication services subject to the City\u2019s UUT. However, at the current time, customers who purchase prepaid phone cards avoid paying any UUT. With prepaid wireless, there is no contract, no monthly invoices, and the phone cards are usually sold by retailers, not service providers themselves. It is estimated that approximately 70% of all prepaid phone cards are sold by retailers in transactions that bypass local UUT. As prepaid options become more common, the City stands to lose revenue as more people shift from service contracts. Additionally, traditional phone plan users are treated disparately and the burden of the UUT is not equally shared among all telephone users.", "AB 1717 protects existing and future revenues by providing a collection mechanism for existing and future UUT revenues and removes the loophole that existed regarding prepaid telephony services. Beginning January 1, 2016, California retailers will be required to collect the local UUT (as well as certain State-assessed administrative charges) at the same time they collect sales tax on the retail product, based on the point of sale.  It is estimated that implementation of AB 1717 will increase UUT on mobile telecommunication services by approximately 20%.", "Under this new law, all local jurisdictions are required to contract with the California State Board of Equalization (BOE) for collection and remittance of local UUT imposed on consumers of prepaid phone cards. In order to simplify and reduce the costs of the Statewide collection process, which would require the monitoring of the UUT rates of the approximately 150 cities that levy a UUT, AB 1717 substitutes a schedule of nine tax rates (on prepaid mobile telephony services only) for the individual rate charged by each city. The rate for Santa Monica will be 9%. The Santa Monica general UUT rate of 10% will continue to apply to all other utility services, including mobile telephone service contracts.", "The law also requires Council to adopt a resolution denoting City staff and any third party consultant authorized to examine prepaid telephony records tax records of the BOE, as this is considered confidential information per Sections 42110 and 42103 of the State Revenue and Taxation Code.

Santa Monica voters first expressed their support for housing affordability with the adoption of the rent-control charter amendment in 1979. Residents continued to affirm the importance of an inclusive community with the adoption of Proposition R (1990), requiring that 30 percent of all new multifamily housing be affordable to low- and moderate-income households, and the adoption of Proposition I (1998), authorizing the City to participate financially in creating affordable housing equal to one-half of one percent of the existing housing stock annually (approximately 250 residences.) A third local initiative, the Tenant Ownership Rights Charter Amendment (TORCA, 2002), amended the charter to direct the use of TORCA condominium conversion fees toward affordablehousing.", "Council has further facilitated affordable housing through the adoption of land use incentives and administrative funding guidelines to streamline affordable housing preservation and production.

During its final ten years, the Redevelopment Agency accounted for between 80 and 95 percent of Santa Monica\u2019s funding for affordable housing preservation andproduction. In November 2014, Santa Monica voters considered a ballot measure to increase the local real estate transfer tax, as well as a companion measure to direct all funds toward affordable housing if the transfer tax increased were approved. While a majority of voters supported directing funds toward affordable housing, the transfer tax increase failed to receive majority support. As a result, the City is left without a significant, stable source of funding for affordable housing. The Housing Commission has prioritized its efforts for 2015 to focus on affordable housing finance. The Commission has hosted a series of speakers, including current and former mayors, non-profit affordable housing organizations and social service organizations, and City staff, to speak to the relevant topics. To complement Council\u2019s deliberations, the Commission expects to prepare recommendations before the end of the calendar year.", "The following provides background information regarding the history and current status of housing affordability in Santa Monica, including rent control, deed-restricted affordable housing, and potential means for measuring the need for affordable housing in Santa Monica.", "Rent Control", "The adoption and implementation of rent control ensured a wide range of housing affordability in Santa Monica during its first two decades. However, the California Legislature passed two laws that critically affected the continued ability of local rent control laws to ensure housing affordability within the rent-controlled stock. The first, passed in 1985 and known as the Ellis Act, allowed property owners to go out of the rental housing business and thereby remove rent-controlled housing. InSanta Monica, the Ellis Act has been used to demolish existing rent-controlled apartments to be replaced by a variety of other uses, including for-sale condominiums, single-family dwellings, apartments, and commercial uses. The 2014 Rent Control Board Consolidated Annual Report shows that nearly 2,000 rent-controlled apartments have been removed pursuant to the Ellis Act.", "The second major impact on rent control came from the state legislature\u2019s 1995 passage of the Costa-Hawkins Act. The Costa-Hawkins Act allows a property owner to increase the rent on a rent-controlled apartment to market rate whenever an apartment becomes vacant. The law went into full effect on January 1, 1999. The 2014 Rent Control Report shows that nearly 67 percent of rent-controlled apartments have been rented at least once at market rates since the 1998. Through 2014, the impacts of the Costa-Hawkins Act are that approximately 18,780 apartments have been rented at market rates since 1998, while the remaining approximately 8,980 apartments serve tenants at long-term controlled rents. The net effect of Costa-Hawkins has been a dramatic reduction of Santa Monica apartments that are affordable to low- and moderate-income households. In 1998, approximately 60 percent of the total housing supply in Santa Monica was affordable to low- and moderate-income households. By2014, approximately one-third of the housing supply was affordable to these households, reflecting deed-restricted affordable housing, nearly 9,000 long-term rent\u2011controlled apartments, and approximately 3,900 rent-controlled apartments that have rented at least once at market rates (presumably in the early years after vacancy decontrol took effect.) The Rent Control Annual Report demonstrates that long-term rent-controlled apartments continue to go to market each year, ranging between 400 and 550 apartments each year over the last five years. At the current rate, the long-term rent-controlled stock will have mostly disappeared within the next 18 to 20 years. The remaining apartments that are affordable to low- and moderate-income households primarily will be those that contain deed restrictions, including newly constructed affordable housing as well as existing apartments that were purchased, rehabilitated, and deed restricted by non-profit affordable housing organizations.", "Deed-Restricted Affordable Housing", "For several decades, the City has implemented policies and programs to increase the supply of deed-restricted residences that are affordable to low- and moderate-income households. The strategy primarily involves three components:", "1. Public financing to support the acquisition, rehabilitation, and deed restriction of existing housing;", "2. Public financing to support the construction of new deed-restricted housing;", "3. Deed-restricted housing developed by private, for-profit organizations pursuant to the AHPP or development agreements.", "Currently, there are approximately 4,500 residences in Santa Monica that have been deed-restricted pursuant to the three strategies above, as identified below:", "Deed-Restricted Residences", "Acquisition / rehabilitation", "1,096", "New construction", "City-funded", "1,845", "HUD-funded (no City funding)", "Inclusionary (AHPP, DAs)", "529", "966", "TOTAL", "4,436", "Each strategy has played an important role in the City\u2019s affordable housing program, as discussed below:", "Acquisition and rehabilitation", "For over three decades, the City has made loans to non-profit housing organizations to purchase existing apartment buildings, which were primarily built before 1979 and are subject to rent control. Once acquired, the non-profit organizations rehabilitate the buildings, including replacing major systems (roofs, windows, electric service, plumbing, etc.), abating any toxic materials (asbestos, lead), and installing energy-efficient appliances and systems. All apartments are deed-restricted for occupancy by low\u2011income households, though existing tenants are protected by rent control and are allowed to stay in their homes, irrespective of their incomes. Consequently, the deed restrictions apply to new tenants. Acquisition affords existing tenants with peace of mind knowing that they will not be evicted pursuant to the Ellis Act. Acquisition also helps support historic preservation and neighborhoodpreservation. Several Santa Monica buildings built in the early 20th Century have been acquired and preserved as affordable housing, as have several courtyard apartment buildings that play an important role in neighborhood identity. Rehabilitated affordable apartments exist in every Santa Monica neighborhood, including North of Montana and Sunset Park. Rehabilitation accounts for approximately 41 percent of the City\u2019s housing loans.", "While acquisition and rehabilitation of existing rent-controlled buildings has played a central role in the City\u2019s affordable housing programs, it has limitations. First, allowing existing tenants to stay in place, irrespective of income, limits the ability for rehabilitation projects to leverage City funding with outside funding, such as low-income housing tax credits. As a result, while the total development costs per apartment for rehabilitation are typically lower than for new construction, the City\u2019s contributions are typically higher than for new construction, where tax credits, state bond funding, and other sources play a critical leveraging role. Second, because the majority of existing apartment buildings in Santa Monica contain studio and one-bedroom apartments, there are limited opportunities to create housing for larger families. Third, rehabilitation potentially channels the City\u2019s limited financial resources for affordable housing toward tenants that would not otherwise qualify for affordable housing, at least during the interim period until vacancies occur in each rehabilitated apartment. As a result, rehabilitated units occupied by over-income tenants do not immediately qualify as affordable housing within the meaning of state law. Therehabilitated residences also do not qualify under Proposition R, which focuses on the delivery of new apartments. Finally, most existing apartment buildings do not include central facilities where enrichment activities, such as after-school homework centers, community classes, and social service support centers, can be housed. As a result, the City\u2019s affordable housing strategy has also included construction of new buildings that are deed-restricted for occupancy by low-income households.", "New construction", "Construction of new apartment buildings allows the City and affordable housing organizations to achieve outcomes that are not typically possible with rehabilitation of existing buildings. The outcomes include providing housing that is targeted to the needs of families, seniors, people with disabilities, and formerly homeless households. The newly constructed buildings often include central facilities such as community rooms (some of which are programmed by the Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Club to provide educational and recreational activities outside of school hours) and case-management centers and services for people with disabilities and formerly homeless individuals. New construction also allows for a focus on implementation of highly sustainable building features. New construction of affordable housing has occurred throughout Santa Monica\u2019s commercial and multifamily districts. In the past few years, most new construction has occurred within commercial districts. Approximately 59 percent of all City loans have been associated with new construction.", "Inclusionary housing", "The City\u2019s efforts to finance the preservation and production of affordable housing have been complemented by affordable housing developed by for-profit developers pursuant to the AHPP or development agreements. Inclusionary housing mitigates the impacts of market-rate housing development and increases the total supply of affordable housing. It also increases the supply of affordable housing in areas that might otherwise not be accessible to non-profit affordable housing developers (such as high-cost areas like Santa Monica\u2019s downtown.) While the AHPP allows a developer of market-rate housing to pay a fee in certain situations, inclusionary housing programs have resulted in the creation of nearly 1,000 deed-restricted apartments, as identified above. In addition, all inclusionary housing that has been approved since 2009 is required to accept prospective tenants from the City\u2019s consolidated affordable housing list. Such an approach not only ensures that appropriately qualified tenants occupy inclusionary housing, it also creates difficult-to-find opportunities for some of the neediest tenants who rely on rental assistance programs administered by the Housing Authority.", "However, the City cannot rely solely on inclusionary housing to meet Santa Monica\u2019s affordable housing goals. First, inclusionary housing alone is highly unlikely to produce sufficient affordable housing to meet the City\u2019s goals, including those identified in Proposition R. Second, inclusionary housing is also unlikely to include the type of amenities and services (after-school homework assistance, parenting classes, case management, etc.) associated with non-profit affordable housing. Finally, inclusionary housing production is primarily reliant on market-rate housing production. Duringperiods when little market-rate housing is produced (i.e. real estate recessions, period of regulatory change, etc.), little inclusionary housing is produced.", "Results of Three Strategies", "By pursuing a three-pronged approach to increasing affordable housing resources, the City has preserved and produced a larger and more diverse supply of low- and moderate-income housing than otherwise would be possible if the City pursued a single strategy. With respect to the production of new affordable housing, the City has exceeded the goals of Proposition R, with 40 percent of all new housing built over the past 20 years being deed-restricted for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households.", "The three strategies are complemented by the City\u2019s rental assistance programs that are administered by the Santa Monica Housing Authority. The assistance programs, including Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, Continuum of Care vouchers (formerly known as Shelter Plus Care and Serial Inebriate Program vouchers), and HOME Tenant-Based Rental Assistance vouchers provide rental assistance to approximately 1,300 Santa Monica households. Households with rental vouchers are typically at the lowest end of the economic spectrum, with average incomes of less than $1,000 per month, who would otherwise be unable to access any housing in Santa Monica. Vouchers allow extremely low-income households to access private housing, non-profit housing, and inclusionary housing.", "The continuing increase in rents in Santa Monica is creating negative impacts on the City\u2019s voucher programs, primarily because the voucher rent payment amounts are continually falling behind market rents. As a result, most voucher-holders find it very difficult to find housing in the private market. While inclusionary housing (particularly newer housing that is required to draw from the City\u2019s housing list) and non-profit-owned housing are rent-accessible for voucher-holders, deed-restricted housing is a limited resource with lower levels of turn-over. At present, households who are issued new vouchers have a very difficult time finding housing in Santa Monica. Staff is currently working with HUD to prepare a request to increase the Santa Monica Housing Authority\u2019s voucher payment standard. Staff anticipates submitting the final request in September, with HUD review expected to take 60 to 90 days. In spite of compelling evidence, it seems highly unlikely that HUD would approve an increase in the payment standard all the way to true competitiveness, given that market rent in Santa Monica is nearly twice the amount that is authorized generally in the region.", "Discussion", "This staff report presents different means to address the question of what is the current need for affordable housing in Santa Monica. Following the discussion of needs, the staff report discusses potential avenues to support the continued preservation and production of affordable housing.", "How to measure the current need for affordable housing?", "In its deliberations, the Housing Commission has asked the question of how to measure the need for affordable housing in Santa Monica.

The following summarizes some key data in support of the Council discussion.", "SCAG\u2019s RHNA allocation", "To assist cities in the preparation of housing elements, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) prepares a Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) allocation for each jurisdiction in the five-county region. The allocation identifies the amount of extremely low-income, low-income, moderate-income, and other housing that should be produced in each city over a specific period in order to address regional housing needs. For Santa Monica, SCAG has determined that 974residences that are affordable to low- and moderate-income households should be created by 2021. While there are many questions about the methodology and resultant equity of the SCAG allocations, it is the most definitive number addressing the need. Since the housing element period began in 2014, Santa Monica has approved 490low\u2011and moderate-income residences, resulting in a remaining need of 484 residences.", "Affordable residences compared to resident incomes", "Another potential means to assess the need for affordable housing is to compare the number of residences that are affordable to low- and moderate-income households relative to the number of residents whose incomes would be categorized as low or moderate income. If the number of qualified residents is greater than the number of affordable homes, it could indicate that some current residents are rent-burdened (paying more than 30 percent of their incomes for housing) or severely rent-burdened (paying more than 50 percent of their incomes for housing.)", "In attempting to quantify the congruence of Santa Monica rents and resident incomes, staff started by looking at the current affordable rent levels compared to 2014 market rents, as shown in Figure 1 below.", "FIGURE 1", "FIGURE 1: Maximum Allowable Rents", "Market Rents", "Unit", "Type", "E Low", "(30%)", "V Low", "(50%)", "Low", "(80%)", "Mod", "(120%)", "2014", "0 Bed", "$340", "$567", "$680", "$1,247", "$1,450", "1 Bed", "$389", "$648", "$778", "$1,426", "$1,895", "2 Bed", "$437", "$729", "$875", "$1,604", "$2,500", "3 Bed", "$486", "$810", "$972", "$1,925", "$3,196", "Figure 1 demonstrates the maximum allowable rent for each apartment size relative to the various income categories, with extremely low-income households defined as those making no more than 30 percent of the area median income (AMI), very low-income households making no more than 50 percent of the AMI, low-income households making no more than 80 percent of the AMI, and moderate-income households making no more than 120 percent of the AMI.

If current trends continue, all long-term rent- controlled apartments will have gone to market rents in the next 18 to 20 years.", "A comparison of the supply of affordable apartments to the Santa Monica households that could qualify for affordable housing is shown in Figure 6.", "FIGURE 6: Comparing resident incomes and affordable rents", "Low- and moderate-income households", "23,387", "Apartments affordable to low- and moderate-income households", "16,178", "POTENTIAL MISMATCH", "7,209", "Figure 6 finds that there is a potential mismatch of more than 7,000 homes relative to residents who would qualify. Some of the mismatch could be attributable to long-term residents of owner-occupied housing who purchased their homes when prices were lower and more affordable. There is likely an additional large contingent of residents who are rent-burdened or severely rent-burdened.", "Income Diversity", "Another means to assess the need for affordable housing is to analyze the income diversity within Santa Monica. Many community members consider Santa Monica\u2019s diversity and inclusiveness to be one of its hallmarks, and something that distinguishes it from other similarly desirable cities. Some have expressed concerns that Santa Monica is rapidly losing the qualities of inclusiveness that make it unique relative to similar communities. One measure of equity and inclusiveness is to look at Santa Monica\u2019s affordable housing profile before vacancy decontrol took effect and that profile today. Data from the Rent Control Annual Report, as well as the count of deed-restricted apartments, relative to the total number of residences in Santa Monica, shows the following affordability levels in 1998 and in 2013.", "FIGURE 7: Percentage of residences affordable to low/moderate-income households", "Figure 7 demonstrates that 60 percent of all Santa Monica residences were affordable to low- and moderate-income households in 1998, before vacancy control went into full effect, while 33 percent were affordable in 2013.", "Barring any significant changes in state law with respect to the Costa-Hawkins Act, the majority of the rent-controlled housing that is currently affordable to low- and moderate-income households is not expected to be affordable in the long run. As a result, it would require a huge infusion of deed-restricted apartments, either through acquisition of existing apartment buildings or construction of new affordable residences, in order to maintain the current diversity of housing, let alone return to the diversity of 1998. Theaffordable housing production numbers necessary to maintain or enhance diversity are far beyond anything Santa Monica has ever seen or is likely to see.", "Affordable housing for Santa Monica\u2019s workforce", "The measures above provide a variety of different ways to look at the need for affordable housing among Santa Monica residents. An additional way to look at the issue is the need for affordable housing among people who work in Santa Monica. Thelocal workforce spends a large percentage of its waking hours in Santa Monica and is a major source of transportation demand associated with commutes into Santa Monica.", "Data from the California Employment Development Department (EDD) shows that there were over 86,000 jobs in Santa Monica in 2014. Approximately one-third of Santa Monica residents who are in the workforce are employed in Santa Monica, or approximately 20,000 workers, leaving approximately 68,000 workers in Santa Monica who live outside Santa Monica. The Commercial Nexus Study that was completed by RSG in 2013 identified the percentage of employees in different industries with low or moderate incomes. Applying the percentages to the industry breakdown provided by the EDD results in an average of 71 percent of workers who would be expected to earn low- or moderate-level incomes. (The percentage ranges from 58 percent to 91percent, depending on the industry. Santa Monica experiences two countervailing forces in this regard. First, Santa Monica has large technology and entertainment industries that tend to pay higher incomes. Those industries are balanced against even larger accommodation and food service industries, which tend to have many lower-income workers.) Applying the 71 percent ratio results in an estimated 48,700 low- and moderate-income, non-resident workers. The final piece in assessing the need among the workers is to estimate how many workers would seek to live in Santa Monica if they could find affordable housing. The RSG study used a conservative figure of 34 percent, which would result in 16,600 workers seeking affordable housing. Given that Santa Monica is one of the most desirable communities in the region, it is possible the percentage would be much higher.", "Housing capital funding", "Another way to assess the unmet need is to evaluate the City\u2019s historical contribution to affordable housing relative to necessary future contributions to ensure the continued pace of creating affordable housing opportunities. As discussed above, the City\u2019s affordable housing policies have relied on a three-pronged strategy that includes acquisition and rehabilitation of existing housing, construction of new housing, and inclusionary housing. The first two elements of the strategy have relied heavily on the City\u2019s ability to leverage outside funding sources and close the financing gap to make affordable housing projects feasible. While funding is not an ideal measurement of need, given that it addresses inputs rather than outcomes, it could be used to create targets in the context of the City budget and other financing sources. During the years leading up to the demise of the Santa Monica Redevelopment Agency, the City was committing over $15million per year toward the production and preservation of affordable housing. City financing, combined with leveraging of outside funding and the inclusionary housing program, played a key role in exceeding the goals of Proposition R. TheCouncil approved the allocation of $20 million to $30 million of one-time funds during FY 15/16 and FY 16/17 to support the continued financing of affordable housing. Thereafter, however, the City\u2019s projected contribution amounts to approximately $2million per year.", "Affordable Housing Financing Opportunities", "Presuming Council considers the preservation and production of affordable housing to be a continuing local priority, the following section discusses potential financing opportunities, irrespective of which measure is used to assess the current and future need for affordable housing. Thediscussion considers opportunities at the federal, state, county, and local levels.", "Federal Opportunities", "Policymaking at the federal level continues to be dominated by gridlock and interparty hostility. Many legislators in Congress are generally opposed to government programs that support low-income people. Programs funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are frequently under attack, including a recent Congressional proposal to cut funding for the HOME program by over 90 percent. Evenfederal low-income housing tax credits (LIHTC), which have played a critical role in leveraging local funds for construction of new affordable housing, have come under attack, including attempts to exclude projects that exceed a certain level of total development costs, which would severely affect high-cost areas such as Santa Monica.", "One bright spot at the federal level is the creation of the National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF) which is to be created in 2016. Funding for the NHTF will be based on a fraction of a percent of loans made by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and should thereby not be subject to the politically charged federal appropriations process. The NHTF is expected to produce between $120 million and $200 million annually. While it is a very small amount on a national scale, it will be important nationally, especially with its focus on serving the needs of extremely low-income households.", "State Opportunities", "The state legislature continues to pursue strategies to restore funding for affordable housing in California, which exceeded $1 billion annually from redevelopment agenciesalone, prior to the dissolution of redevelopment. A significant new funding source is the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities (AHSC) program, which will receive a fixed portion of funds generated by the emissions cap and trade program. The first round funding for the program was recently completed, with over $120 million granted primarily to affordable housing developments. The first round application and selection criteria had very tight criteria, including fully entitled projects with proximity to high-frequency transit service. As there were no entitled Santa Monica affordable housing developments that met the funding requirements, there was not an opportunity to apply during the first round. There could be opportunities to apply in future rounds if appropriate sites can be identified and entitled. A critical element of the program, and a key part of the authorizing legislation, is to channel at least 50 percent of the funds to disadvantaged communities. While projects in Santa Monica will be less competitive because there are no census tracts in Santa Monica that meet the disadvantaged community designation, Santa Monica\u2019s competitiveness will be enhanced by the location of three light-rail stations. Staff will continue to work with non-profit housing organizations to explore potential opportunities to qualify for AHSC funding. However, it is unlikely that the AHSC funds will be sufficient to close the funding gap for affordable housing. As a result, local contributions will likely be necessary to leverage AHSC funds.", "In September 2014, Governor Brown signed legislation creating Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs). Touted by some as Redevelopment 2.0, EIFDs allow cities to use tax-increment financing. However, in order for any property taxes to be available beyond those that would otherwise accrue to the sponsoring city, the affected taxing agencies must agree that incremental growth in property taxes will accrue to the EIFD rather than to the taxing agency. As counties are typically the largest taxing entities, county approval will likely be necessary to have any significant revenue opportunities. Other than a few isolated cases, it seems unlikely that EIFDs will become a significant source of financing for affordable housing or infrastructure, unless the legislation is significantly amended.", "Since redevelopment dissolution, legislators have proposed the imposition of a small fee on the recording of real estate documents, with the funds targeted toward affordable housing. The City has actively supported the legislation, including in its current form, AB 1335. The proposal would impose a $75 fee on recorded documents and could raise as much as $500 million annually. Whether the proposal will make it out of the legislature, and whether the governor would sign the legislation, is currently uncertain. If both occur, it is unclear how the funds would be allocated and how much would reach Santa Monica. Under any scenario, it is unlikely that the funds would be sufficient to fill the financing gap for any project. Local funds would likely be necessary to leverage the state funds.", "The package of bills in support of affordable housing also includes a bill (AB 35) that would increase California\u2019s LIHTC allocation by $300 million annually, which would leverage an additional $600 million of federal LIHTC. Increased tax credits could further opportunities to leverage local funding for affordable housing.", "In 2013, the state legislature restructured the Veteran\u2019s Bond Act of 2008 to create the Veteran\u2019s Housing and Homelessness Prevention (VHPP) Program. The VHPP authorizes nearly $600 million of funding over the next several years to support the creation of affordable housing for veterans and their families. Theprogram could be used to leverage funding for a veteran-focused housing opportunity in Santa Monica.", "Under any of the opportunities identified above, it is important to recognize that none of the sources would be expected to provide financial leveraging for the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing rent-controlled housing, because outside funding sources typically require that any subsidized residences be occupied immediately by income-qualified residents.", "Though not directly related to affordable housing financing, the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June upholding San Jose\u2019s inclusionary housing ordinance provides important legal support for the third prong of Santa Monica\u2019s affordable housing strategy. Pursuant to Council direction, staff and the City Attorney\u2019s Office are evaluating whether the court decision provides additional flexibility with respect to the methodology and design of Santa Monica\u2019s AHPP.", "County Opportunities", "The County of Los Angeles has been the biggest beneficiary of redevelopment dissolution in the region. For example, over 40 percent of the funds that would otherwise have been allocated to the Santa Monica Redevelopment Agency are now being distributed to L.A. County. Many people have been urging the Board of Supervisors to allocate a portion of the funds toward affordable housing. The Board has made some initial allocations and there is hope that the County will continue to support affordable housing. County support has been and will likely continue to be directly toward special-needs housing that serves the needs of homeless and mentally ill households. Prospective special-needs housing proposals in Santa Monica could benefit from the support. In addition, the County Departments of Health Services and Mental Health have both identified the importance of permanent, supportive housing and have contributed funding as a result.", "Local Opportunities", "If Santa Monica wants to ensure a robust affordable housing program that addresses a variety of community needs and values, the development of a stable local funding source is necessary. Local funds have played a central role in leveraging outside funding sources, such as tax credits and state bonds, and would likely be necessary to be competitive for any new outside funding sources. Local funds typically are necessary to support land acquisition, which is critical because of high land costs in Santa Monica and because many outside funding sources require site control. Certainoutside funding sources also score funding application competitiveness based on the amount of local leveraging. Local funds also serve as the primary funding source for the preservation of existing rent-controlled housing stock, due to outside funding limitations on protecting existing tenants who do not meet income qualifications.", "There are a variety of approaches to consider for funding affordable housing, as discussed below:", "\u00b7 Cut other City services: Council could carve out a portion of the General Fund that could be allocated toward affordable housing. A primary challenge with such an approach is that virtually every service supported by the General Fund has a constituency that relies on the service. In addition, such an approach could create a dynamic of affordable housing vs. libraries, social services, education, or public safety, all of which are critical to the success of residents of affordable housing.", "\u00b7 Flat-line City services: Council could hold funding for all General Fund services at a fixed level and allocate any growth in revenues toward affordable housing. Aprimary challenge with such an approach is that the City\u2019s costs, including supplies and equipment, labor, health care, pensions, etc. continue to grow, often at a pace faster than the cost of revenue growth. FixingGeneral Fund expenditures at a set level would require a reduction of services to offset inflationary pressures.", "\u00b7 Allocate all revenue above an inflation factor toward affordable housing: Council could ensure that existing City operations receive inflationary increases to ensure continued operations, while allocating any excess revenues toward affordable housing. The challenge of such an approach is that it does not create a stable source of funding for affordable housing, as some years could be very lean or non-existent with respect to revenues exceeding costs increases. It would also limit the Council\u2019s ability to address other emerging needs, which in the past year have included additional public safety personnel and conversion of as-needed employees to permanent status.", "If the Council wanted to avoid impacting existing City services while creating a stable and dependable funding source for affordable housing, increased revenue sources that could then be allocated toward affordable housing is an option.

With approval of the Rent Control Board or explicit ballot language, owners of apartment buildings could pass the tax on to their tenants.", "\u00b7 Transient Occupancy Tax: An increase in the TOT on hotel visits requires majority approval by voters. Each increase of one percentage point to the TOT results in approximately $3 million in increased funding to the City. Santa Monica\u2019s current tax rate is 14percent. Only two cities in California have higher TOT rates: Anaheim at 15 percent and Garden Grove at 14.5 percent. The TOT rates in Los Angeles, Culver City, and Beverly Hills are on par with Santa Monica\u2019s 14 percent rate. An increase in the TOT rate could appeal to voters because it is paid mostly by non-residents. However, if the local hotel industry were to oppose the rate increase, it could wage a well-funded opposition campaign.", "\u00b7 Sales Tax: An increase in the sales tax requires majority voter approval. Each quarter-cent increase in the sales tax results in approximately $7.5 million of additional revenue to the City. The City\u2019s current sales tax rate, including the transaction and use tax adopted by voters in 2010, is 9.5 percent. The maximum allowed sales tax rate in California is 10 percent. If the County electorate adopts a sales tax increase to support transit on the same ballot that a sales tax increase is adopted in Santa Monica, both sales taxes increases would be valid, though there could be voter antipathy toward two sales tax increases on the same ballot. Currently, fewer than ten cities in California have sales tax rates of 10 percent. Culver City\u2019s rate of 9.5 percent matches Santa Monica\u2019s, while the cities of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills impose rates of 9.0 percent. Some community members have advocated for a one-half percent sales tax increase in Santa Monica, with a companion measure that asks Council to allocate 50 percent of the funding toward school maintenance. The advocacy reflects concern that while approved school bonds are financing new and renovated school facilities, funding for maintenance of existing school facilities continues to be a challenge.", "\u00b7 Real Property Transfer Tax: An increase in the real property transfer tax requires majority voter approval. Every $1.50 increase in the real property transfer tax is expected to raise approximately $2.4 million per year, though transfer tax receipts are extremely volatile in any year. Santa Monica\u2019s current tax rate is $3 per $1,000 of sale value. While some Northern California cities have transfer tax rates of up to $15 per $1,000 of sale value (including a San Francisco rate that goes up to $25 per $1,000), the rates in Culver City and Los Angeles are $4.50 per $1,000, while Beverly Hills maintains the general rate of $1.10 per $1,000. In November2014, Santa Monica voters rejected an increase in the real property transfer tax, following a well-funded opposition campaign by the California Association of Realtors.", "\u00b7 Parking Tax: An increase in the parking tax requires majority voter approval. Every one percentage point increase in the parking tax could be expected to raise approximately $1million annually. However, because the City\u2019s owns 30 percent of the parking in Santa Monica, nearly a third of the funds would not be realized unless Council increased public parking rates, which are carefully set to achieve a variety of public policy goals. The current parking tax of 10 percent is among the highest in the region.", "\u00b7 Utility User Tax: Increasing the utility user tax requires majority voter approval. Every one percentage point increase in the utility user tax could increase City funding by approximately $3 million. Santa Monica\u2019s rate of 10 percent is among the highest in the region. Every voter pays the utility user tax.", "\u00b7 Parcel Tax: Imposing a parcel tax requires two-thirds voter approval.

Anenhanced voucher is attached to the tenant, not the property, and only protects tenants from future rent increases. Current tenants may use the enhanced voucher either at Neilson Villa or at another property if they relocate. While enhanced vouchers would provide some affordability protection for current tenants, vouchers are lost to the property once a tenant vacates.

Otherwise, if annual net cash flow exceeds $770,000, the portion above that amount would be disbursed to the City annually. The City could then use the excess funds to support the production and preservation of affordable housing elsewhere in SantaMonica. Finally, the Neilson Villa owners have been good stewards of the property, as confirmed by inspection reports from HUD, indicating high scores reflecting a well-maintained property.", "Preserving Long-term Affordability", "Modifying the Contract to extend the affordability covenant period for 55 years would achieve long-term affordability, defer the City\u2019s option to purchase the property during the term of the new Contract, and require no City funding. The extension proposal represents very deep affordability targeting. Under the proposed extension terms, if all 100 housing vouchers (20 existing, 80 proposed) were lost due to funding cuts from Congress, Neilson Villa would be subject to the following affordability requirements:", "# of apartments", "% of median income", "maximum income", "(1-person hhld)", "2015 monthly rent limit", "40", "30", "$17,950", "$ 389", "35", "40", "$23,900", "$ 518", "10", "50", "$29,900", "$ 648", "10", "80", "$47,850", "$ 778", "5", "95", "$56,700", "$1,231", "Protecting Seniors with Affordable Rent", "Current rents for the 80 unsubsidized apartments (other than the 20 apartments with Section 8 vouchers) are low in comparison to market standards, averaging below $500per month. However, many of the senior households living at Neilson Villa are extremely low-income households (with only Social Security income) and currently pay more than 30 percent of their incomes toward rent, with some paying more than 50percent of their incomes toward rent. Rents have continued to increase in conjunction with increased operating expenses. Approving prepayment of the Section236 loan would trigger the issuance of 80 new enhanced vouchers by HUD to be administered by the Santa Monica Housing Authority (SMHA). The four main benefits to these vouchers are:", "1) Enhanced vouchers would hold tenants\u2019 portion of rent at current levels with future rent increases paid by the voucher;", "2) If HUD approves the conversion from enhanced vouchers to Project-Based Section 8 vouchers, rents could be reduced for many seniors who are currently rent-burdened;", "3) Would add more than $800,000 in annual revenue for the property to enhance financial viability; and", "4) Would increase the SMHA voucher allocation by 80 new vouchers, including voucher administration according to locally adopted regulations.", "The enhanced vouchers would be issued initially as \u201ctenant-based\u201d vouchers to the existing tenants. Tenants could remain at Neilson Villa or move if desired and use the vouchers elsewhere. Tenants would continue paying rent at their current levels, but would be protected from subsequent rent increases, which would be covered by thevouchers. However, federal rules allow the vouchers to be converted to Section 8 Project-Based Vouchers, if tenants agree to the conversion. In this scenario, the vouchers would stay with the Neilson Villa property but the tenant portion of rent would be adjusted (most likely reduced) to an amount equal to 30 to 40 percent of the household income. This approach would bring financial relief to seniors who are currently rent-burdened, while strengthening the financial feasibility of the property.", "Maintaining Financial Feasibility", "As mentioned above, authorizing prepayment of the Section 236 loan would result in the addition of 80 new rental housing vouchers at Neilson Villa, issued by HUD and administered by the SMHA. The additional rental revenue, more than $800,000 annually, would allow the tenants to pay an affordable rent while concurrently strengthening the property's financial capacity. Consequently, the owners have agreed to fund a $1.7 million affordability reserve, as a form of voucher insurance, to protect tenants in the event Congress reduced the voucher allocation or funding. Additionally,the increased revenue stream from the vouchers would allow for setting aside $45,000 per year in a reserve account toward future capital replacements or significant and unforeseen repairs.", "The anticipated operating expenses of Neilson Villa are projected at $5,500 per apartment per year, consistent with industry standards. Property management fees would be consistent with HUD-approved rates.  Additionally, the proposal includes a preferred return to the owners of $770,000 annually, which would include any payments to entities related to the owners except for property management. Any net cash remaining after the payment of operating expenses, replacement reserves deposit, and preferred return would be paid to the City annually.", "Upholding Property Maintenance", "If the Contract is extended, oversight of Neilson Villa would be the jurisdiction of both HUD and the Santa Monica Housing Authority. Eligible senior applicants would be selected from the Housing Authority waiting list, eligibility determinations would be made by Housing Authority staff, and apartments would be inspected biennially by the HousingAuthority. HUD would continue to inspect and monitor the 20 original Section8apartments. The combination of factors provides assurance that the property will be well-managed with ongoing oversight.", "As mentioned above, inspection reports from HUD (in conjunction with the Section 236 loan) reflect a well-maintained property. The property management firm, G & K Management Company, has managed Neilson Villa since its opening in 1977 and has the capacity to manage and operate a large property with its portfolio of residential properties in California (69 in total). G & K has demonstrated good overall property management at Neilson Villa. Continuing the current ownership and management structure would support consistent property management for the residents.", "Facilitating Necessary Rehabilitation", "Neilson Villa is a 38-year-old building and some of the building systems and apartment interiors are reaching the end of their useful life. The property would benefit from preventative replacement or upgrading of various building components and the owners have already committed a minimum of $1 million toward near-term rehabilitation needs. Funds for this purpose are already in a property-reserve account. Additionally, the owners have agreed to set aside $45,000 annually in a reserve account for capital replacement needs. The City recently commissioned a Property Condition Assessment (PCA) which evaluated the current condition of the building and identified necessary capital replacement items needed within the next 12 years. The PCA concluded that a total of $564,000 in rehabilitation work is foreseen at this time. Based upon the existing $1 million reserve fund, the annual $45,000 reserves deposit, and the estimated net cash flow, there is sufficient funding to cover the anticipated rehabilitation.", "Alternatives", "City purchase: An alternative to Contract modification would be for the City to exercise its option to purchase theproperty. The existing Contract provides the City with an option to purchase the property in 2018 (41 years after completion of the property) by paying one dollar for the land and fair-market value for the improvements. A primary advantage of exercising the option is that it would give complete control to the City regarding the future of the property and allow the City to ensure affordability by setting rent levels. Also, the City would benefit from any net cash flow generated by the property. However, if the City indicated its interest in exercising the option, the HUD-approved rent increase for existing tenants would be expected to be implemented immediately, potentially pushing many current tenants into an untenable position. In addition, existing tenants, as well as new tenants, would not be protected from additional rent increases prior to the City\u2019s allowed exercise of the option in 2018.", "Anotherprimary disadvantage is the City\u2019s cost to exercise this option. The purchase price of the value of the existing improvements to the property could be quite significant, and there are a number of subjective judgments that could influence the value conclusion. This is evidenced by the fact that the property owners estimated the value at $30 million to $35 million, while three other perspectives on the value of the improvements result in estimated values of $0, $12.5 million and $32 million.", "The issue of valuing the improvements, based upon the language of the Contract, is challenging and presents an unknown risk to both the City and the Neilson Villa owners.", "The Contract stipulates that the fair market value of the improvements shall be determined by a certified appraiser agreed upon by the City and the Neilson Villaowners. The Contract further stipulates that if the City and the Neilson Villa owners cannot agree upon a single appraiser, then each party shall appoint an appraiser and the two appraisers shall appoint a third appraiser to perform the appraisal. Whether the City and owners agree upon an appraiser or a third appraiser is appointed, the Contract does not provide a methodology for valuing the property improvements. The Appraisal Institute\u2019s standard means for conducting appraisals does not include situation where improvements are to be valued without consideration for underlying land values. As a result, the valuation methodology that would be applied by an appraiser is uncertain, and the valuation conclusion could vary widely depending on the approach used by the selected appraiser.", "The range of methodologies that City staff has been able to identify can be described as follows:", "1. If the improvements are valued based on a depreciated value scenario, the value of the improvements would be zero. This conclusion is based on the fact that the improvements have been fully depreciated for income-tax purposes.", "2. The property owner estimated the improvements\u2019 value at $30 million to $35 million, but did not provide the City with the analysis or assumptions that were applied. Based on a cash flow projection, it appears that the valuation is based on the assumption that all apartments would eventually be converted to market rents pursuant to the vacancy decontrol provisions of the Costa-Hawkins Act. The estimate also appears to attribute all of the property\u2019s value to the improvements, with no value ascribed to the land.", "3. If the value is estimated based on the income restrictions the property owner is proposing to apply, including HUD rental assistance payments, the value of the land and improvements is estimated at $12.5 million.", "As a result, the lack of a defined methodology for valuing the improvements presents unknown financial risks to the City and may end in a dispute. If the appraiser were to determine that the improvements were of significant value, the City would also be challenged in finding funds to exercise the option. If City funds could be identified, the expenditure of funds would not result in the creation of any additional affordable housingresources.", "The City would also assume financial risk if operating expenses exceed rental income (requiring annual operating subsidies) and the financial liability of any deferred maintenance or necessary replacements of major building systems (requiring a significant financial commitment). For example, the $1 million of rehabilitation investment that is currently needed would have to be funded by the City. Furthermore,the 80 enhanced vouchers discussed above would not be available to the property when the loan reaches maturity in 2017 (i.e., is not prepaid), one year before the City\u2019s option arises (in 2018). The allocation and value of the enhanced vouchers would therefore be lost and equates to an operating loss of more than $800,000 in annual revenue to the property, as well as a loss of $1.3 million in new budget authority for the SMHA. Finally,residential property management does not fit well within the core competencies of City operations. City ownership of the property would entail contracting with a property management firm to handle daily operations, as well as after-hours responses in emergencies. Oversight of property management by City staff can be time consuming and detract from the Housing Division\u2019s core mission of facilitating the production and preservation of affordable housing.", "City purchase with transfer to non-profit: A variation of the City purchase option would be for the City to exercise its option and then transfer the property to a nonprofit affordable housing organization to own and operate as affordable housing. The advantage of this approach would be ownership by a mission-driven affordable housing entity. In addition, the deal could be structured so that the City shares in any net cashflow. Adisadvantage would be the lost opportunity to leverage 80 new vouchers from HUD and the financing liability of deferred maintenance and needed rehabilitation. Obtaininga bank loan to fund deferred rehabilitation would be more challenging without the benefit of the voucher rental income and may not provide sufficient financing to cover the cost of the necessary rehabilitation.", "Private owner purchase: Another alternative would be for the City to allow its option to lapse under the existing Contract, which would then require the owners to purchase the City\u2019s land interest.  The existing Contract establishes that if the City does not exercise its option to purchase, the property owners must then pay to the City the value of the land, based upon highest and best use. In this scenario, Neilson Villa would likely be subject to Santa Monica\u2019s Rent Control Law, including the vacancy decontrol provisions. Themain disadvantages to this alternative are: 1) no affordability covenants once the Section 236 loan matures in 2017; 2) lost opportunity to leverage 80 new rental housing vouchers from HUD; and 3) currently rent-burdened seniors would have no relief in the form of lower rents; 4) rents could increase immediately for existing tenants.", "Financial Impacts & Budget Actions", "Implementation of the recommended action requires the following FY 2015-16 budgetchanges:", "1) Increase revenue budget at account 12269.40038V in the amount of $1,300,000 for Santa Monica Housing Authority Housing Assistance Payments.", "2) Appropriate $1,300,000 at expenditure account 122691.577344.", "3) Increase revenue budget at account 12269.40038A in the amount of $18,750 for Santa Monica Housing Authority Administrative Fees.", "4) Appropriate $18,750 at expenditure account 122691.544390."]}], [{"Title": "Compliance with the Congestion Management Program, and Related Development Report", "Department": "Strategic & Transportation Planning (PCD)", "Sponsors": null, "Category": "09.

The City has a AAA bond rating, invests heavily in social services, and recently launched a Local Wellbeing Index, funded by one of only five grants made nationally by Bloomberg Philanthropies. The completion of the $1.5 billion Expo line to Santa Monica is the result of decades of community advocacy at the County level. Santa Monica will shortly launch the first bike share program in the region. The City is engaged in a host of new efforts including: expanding the fastest municipal fiber optic network in the country; seeking to regain local control of land use at the Santa Monica Airport; implementing zoning regulations for medical marijuana; adopting the Downtown Specific Plan; considering becoming the second city in the region to adopt a municipal minimum wage; rebuilding the California Incline; building the Colorado Esplanade from the Downtown rail station; moving towards water independence and cutting overall water use; and more. The energetic engagement of local residents and the pioneering spirit of Councilmembers and staff have propelled the organization to take calculated risks, step forward, and embark on efforts that other municipalities cannot.", "Yet there are costs to this kind of flat-out appetite to simultaneously do more and better. First, it skimps on the kind of careful vetting, civic engagement, and project management that lays the foundation for success. This strain is particularly acute at the funnel of twice-monthly City Council meetings and on the City\u2019s key executive leaders. There is only so much time during Council sessions and only so much time in the workday/workweek. Putting too much pressure on this funnel makes it a chokepoint instead. Council meetings go into the wee hours and executive managers find themselves spread too thinly. Minor oversights and omissions can cascade into costly missteps. The strain of keeping on top of bubbling pots and constantly shifting projects and policies between the front and back burners multiplies the risk of boil-overs and burned fingers.", "All this can, over time, erode external trust and internal pride. Working harder won\u2019t solve the problem. Working smarter can.", "This starts with being strategic about being strategic. Not everything is of equal importance. Not everything is of equal urgency. Balancing the important and the urgent must be intentional and transparent. That means being clear about what is truly important, sticking with that framework, and delivering the promised results on time and on budget.", "In the short run, it means being realistic about what can be realistically done. The organization has the capacity to do almost anything. However, it does not have the capacity to do everything.", "Setting the top priorities is clearly the responsibility of the Council. With this retreat, staff seeks the Council\u2019s active participation in identifying which of the many significant things the City is already doing should rise to the top priorities for the upcoming years. Once those are identified, staff will work with the Council to clearly identify the measures for tracking progress toward achieving those strategic goals.", "It should not be overlooked that today\u2019s Santa Monica is the product of the cumulative pursuit of strategic goals even if they were not always formally identified as such. Big moves over several years and multiple budget cycles have decisively shaped the City\u2019s physical landscape and organizational structure as well as the community\u2019s quality of life and standard of living. The rehabilitation of the Pier, the creation of the Third Street Promenade, securing construction of the Expo line to its terminus in Downtown are all tangible examples of game changers that have influenced the City. Prudent fiscal management to achieve AAA credit rating, fostering of active civic engagement, and the partnership with the Santa Monica School District and college are examples of less visible but equally important strategies that have had consequential impact. A list of a number of such strategic projects and policies in recent years can be found in Attachment A.", "In preparation for this Council session, members of the City\u2019s Leadership Team (managers, department heads, and CMO staff) worked in small interdepartmental groups to identify the many strategic initiatives underway throughout the organization and the associated SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant & Timely) metrics which foster accountability by identifying tangible outcomes and setting deadlines for achieving them.", "Members of the department head team (department heads and CMO staff) reviewed and prioritized items, which were grouped in the following categories:", "\u00b7 mobility", "\u00b7 affordable housing", "\u00b7 emergency preparedness", "\u00b7 homelessness", "\u00b7 planning and development", "\u00b7 sustainability", "\u00b7 technology", "\u00b7 capital improvement and infrastructure", "\u00b7 wellbeing", "\u00b7 communication", "The team then identified the strategic initiatives that once achieved will make a difference and improve the quality of life in Santa Monica.", "Staff is now presenting the Council with the following 12 strategic initiatives and associated SMART metrics for consideration (see attachment B for detailed goals and metrics) and seeks the Council\u2019s direction on the top three to five strategic goals as well as the appropriate SMART metrics to focus on over the next three to five years. The metrics, by and large, are reflected in the FY2015-2017 adopted biennial budget. Others appear on departmental work plans. A few arose through the recent discussion of strategic initiatives and SMART metrics. All are suggestions for the Council\u2019s consideration. Based on Council direction during the retreat, staff may fine tune some of the metrics.", "1. Providing world-class customer service to the community", "2. Establishing a new model for mobility", "3. Addressing homelessness", "4. Maintaining an inclusive and diverse community", "5. Securing local control of the City land occupied by the Santa Monica Airport", "6. Achieving water, energy and climate change sustainability goals", "7. Safeguard Bergamot and the Civic Auditorium assets as cultural hubs", "8. Providing affordable community-wide gigabit speed fiber and wi-fi connectivity", "9. Strengthening downtown as a community hometown with local-serving and cultural amenities", "10. Expanding and improving the resilience of community infrastructure", "11. Taking community civic engagement to the next level", "12. Building on the partnership with SMMUSD and SMC to emphasize Santa Monica as \u201ca learning community\u201d from Cradle to Career and beyond", "This first cut is meant to give the Council a basis to mix, match, trim and change these suggestions to a list of three to five clear choices for top priority strategic goals and associated SMART metrics. Based on Council\u2019s direction, staff will adjust to ensure that the goals and metrics are met within the desired time frames. This may involve shifting appropriate resources to the identified initiatives, modifying the timelines on other projects, or other efforts necessary to achieve the stated goals. It bears repeating that essential City services and programs, work to meet Council\u2019s adopted policy goals, and day-to-day service delivery will continue. Progress on the City\u2019s strategic goals and SMART metrics will be reported during the annual budget adoption process at the time the proposed budget is considered.", "Alternatives", "The Council could identify more or less of the presented strategic initiatives, could create and prioritize different initiatives, and/or develop alternative SMART metrics.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of the recommended action. Clearly, however, the identification of top priority strategic goals and the commitment to achieving them will significantly influence future budgetary allocations. And, current budgets and programs may need to be adjusted at mid-year or other times to implement the strategic goals."]}]]}
