Approve the Santa Monica Pier Corporation FY 2017-18 Budget and Work Plan, and,3. Approve modifications to the Santa Monica Pier Corporation Bylaws.", "Body": ["Executive Summary", "In August, the 2017 Twilight Concert Series (TCS) concluded its 33rd year of free summer concerts at the Santa Monica Pier (Pier), produced by the Santa Monica Pier Corporation (SMPC). The TCS (previously called the Twilight Dance Series) was originally created to attract visitors back to the Pier after it was rebuilt in the wake of the devastating damage from storms back in the 1980\u2019s. The TCS has become an iconic community event and very successful at drawing large crowds of residents, regional visitors, and tourists to the Pier and the adjacent beach.", "Over the years, the TCS has outgrown the Pier deck, and its purpose as originally envisioned. It has evolved into a regional attraction, drawing large crowds to the adjacent beach, and heavily impacting Downtown traffic and parking on already congested Thursday evenings in the summer.  Security, too, has become increasingly expensive and problematic.", "For the past several years, City staff have expressed strong concerns about these and other issues, including the rising costs of security and beach clean-up. During the 2017 season, several significant changes were made by the SMPC (some at the request of the City) to reduce attendance levels of TCS to address safety, security, and environmental concerns. Yet, despite joint planning, the first concert of the season nearly overwhelmed those efforts. Even the downsized series attracted large audiences that compromised public safety, impacted residents and businesses on, and adjacent to the Pier and strained City resources, costing in excess of $1 million, nearly $400,000 over the amount Council budgeted.", "An interdepartmental staff committee has evaluated the TCS and recommends a hiatus for the upcoming 2018season. The hiatus would provide sufficient time for the SMPC Board, its recently appointed new Executive Director, and City, with input from the broader community of residential and business stakeholders (including, among others, Pier tenants), to re-evaluate the purpose and value of the concert series, and to make decisions about timing, scope and funding in the future. The SMPC, recognizing the need to re-imagine the TCS, recommends an alternative that would provide continuity for the concerts: shifting the focus of the series to the fall. Staff has included information on this alternative later in the report.", "In addition to considering the future of TCS, the Services Agreement between the City and SMPC approved by Council on July 14, 2015, requires the preparation of an annual budget and work plan. Inaccordance with the Services Agreement, SMPC is submitting its Fiscal Year 2017-18 (FY 2017-18) Budget and Work plan for Council approval. Finally, revised SMPC Bylaws (Attachment C) are proposed to update term limits to be consistent with City Council Resolution No. 11034 (CCS), which allow Directors to serve two consecutive terms. A third term may be served if the Director makes a written request to serve a third term, or a Councilmember nominates a Director to a third term, and the City Council approves that third term by a two-thirds vote.", "Background", "Free community summer concerts on the Santa Monica Pier (Pier) began in 1983 to draw residents back to the Pier after it had been badly battered by a series of winter storms. In the early years, the Twilight Dance Series drew an audience of several hundred residents, who danced under a tent on the Pier at the site of the former La Monica Ballroom.  Over the years, the concert series (now known as the Twilight Concert Series or TCS) has grown more popular, to the point that its crowd exceeds the Pier\u2019s event capacity. As a result, for many years, the public has assembled on the beach, south of the Pier during the concerts. To support the beach attendees, starting in 2011 the Santa Monica Pier Corporation (SMPC), as well as its predecessor, Santa Monica Pier Restoration Corporation, installed speakers and a jumbotron video screen to broadcast the concerts to the beach. In the past few years, a single Thursday night concert could draw tens of thousands of visitors from around the region to the Santa Monica Pier and adjacent Santa Monica State Beach. The result: closure of the Pier, gridlock in the adjacent downtown area, excessive amounts of trash and debris on the beach, and significant concerns for public safety.", "Council has discussed TCS crowd size and safety challenges in the past. At its meeting on January 14, 2014 (Attachment E), Council reviewed and supported SMPC\u2019s modifications to reposition TCS as a more community-focused series, including the removal of the jumbotron video screen facing the beach, a focus on emerging talent rather than artists with a regional or national fan base, and an improved layout on the beach to increase public safety control and access.  Nevertheless, concert attendance continued to grow, impacting the beach and neighboring areas, and resulted in increased costs to the City for public safety, traffic control, and beach clean-up. On March 28, 2017 (Attachment F), Council reviewed additional changes proposed by the SMPC for the 2017 TCS season to reduce adverse impacts and City costs. Changes included reducing the number of concerts from ten to eight, shifting the series to earlier in the summer, skipping the week of July 4th, implementing a traffic plan, and launching a creative \u201cHow to Twilight\u201d social media campaign to encourage attendees to use alternative transportation and reduce the amount of trash on the beach. Council also allocated $600,000 to cover City-related costs.", "While most of the eight concerts during the 2017 TCS drew between 5,000 and 15,000 attendees per event, the first concert of the season was an anomaly, drawing an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 people. While the SMPC provides private security for the stage and production area on the Pier, the City\u2019s public safety personnel are responsible for crowd control on the beach, Ocean Front Walk, Pier, and downtown areas, at significant expense. While no serious incidents were reported, the large crowds overtaxed the entire oceanfront, making emergency access difficult and compromising public safety.", "Because the Pier\u2019s maximum capacity as a concert venue is approximately 4,300 people, the majority of concertgoers assemble on the beach south of the Pier. What began as a small spillover of people onto the beach has grown into large beach crowds that outnumber the attendees on the Pier and overwhelm the beach infrastructure.", "Unlike the Pier, Santa Monica State Beach is a public space for which access cannot be controlled or regulated to limit the number of public attendees or what they bring with them to the beach. The Pier\u2019s occupancy reaches capacity regularly during the TCS, which results in closure to the Pier, impacting both businesses on the Pier and the public\u2019s enjoyment of the venue and adjacent area. While the City\u2019s public safety officials are able to regulate public attendance on the Pier, the inability to effectively regulate the large number of concentrated concertgoers on the beach has raised particular concern for public safety officials. Even without any significant safety incidents to date, nighttime crowd control efforts on the beach are intensive and challenging, and divert resources from the rest of Santa Monica. Many concertgoers on the beach engage in prohibited activities such as drinking alcohol and smoking, and often leave glass bottles buried in the sand. Finally, rather than occurring in an easily accessible location, the concerts take place at water\u2019s edge on the far side of a crowded Downtown. The location makes both potential emergency response and evacuation of large groups of people problematic at best. In light of the tragic litany of national and international incidents of gun violence and terrorism that target vulnerable crowds, all these factors add to deep and growing concern from the City\u2019s Police and Fire Departments.", "Furthermore, despite TCS\u2019s campaign to reduce litter on the beach, cleanup following each concert continues to be expensive and staff intensive. Beach Maintenance staff reported an average of ten tons of trash collected after each concert, with 15 tons collected after the first concert of the 2017 series. At the close of the concert series, Beach Maintenance crews had to replace the sand in the area because it had become degraded with trash and overuse.", "The Thursday night concert series has also resulted in community complaints about traffic and street congestion in surrounding areas, with traffic and street closures impeding access for residents and patrons of neighboring businesses. Downtown Santa Monica Inc. reported that TCS caused concerning disruption for workers, residents, and businesses in and around downtown.", "On the other hand, the TCS has a loyal following, particularly among young area residents who enjoy the low-key, non-commercial atmosphere of a free outdoor event in an iconic setting. Despite the serious safety concerns, crowds have been well-behaved with few arrests or significant problems. There is no question that the TCS continues to bring positive public and media attention to Santa Monica and that it retains a loyal following among some long-time resident concert goers.  locationd in a series was intended to reduce costs and", "Costs of 2017 TCS", "Since 2014, the City has supplemented SMPC\u2019s annual funding by an additional $200,000 initially to cover SMPC\u2019s increased costs for event security and to offset anticipated lost sponsorship revenues caused by removal of the jumbotron video screen (an early effort to discourage large crowds on the beach). For the 2017 season, the SMPC will use the funds to repay the City, and partially offset some of the expenses for public safety on the beach. However, it is worth noting that this $200,000 was added to the base grant of the SMPC.", "The SMPC\u2019s cost for the production of the free concert series on the Pier totaled approximately $690,000 for 2017, which was almost entirely sponsor-funded and included private security personnel used to control patrons on the Pier and surrounding the production area. However, the added costs to the City for additional police and fire personnel, traffic control, and clean up on the beach and in downtown came to $1,055,672, of which $965,857 were police- and fire-related expenses. Given that the concerts are free and not ticketed, and are promoted on social media, it is not always possible for event organizers to accurately gauge how many people will attend, nor to effectively manage the number of attendees. As a result, the City\u2019s public safety and traffic-control expenses have dramatically increased over the past few years to respond to the risk profile of the large crowd sizes and limited regulation of beach attendees.", "For comparison purposes, the 2016 TCS season was comprised of 10 concerts and the cost per concert to the City on average was $96,698 for police and fire services. The 2017 TCS season was comprised of eight concerts and the cost per concert was $120,732 on average for police and fire services. While the 2017 series was intended to reduce City costs, it resulted in a 25 percent increase in costs from the previous year.", "Beach Maintenance costs for the 2017 TCS season were $32,302. Several changes were made for the 2017 season to reduce the amount of time and labor for Beach Maintenance staff, but costs increased nonetheless from the previous year due to the additional services needed. The large crowds necessitated more portable restrooms, and the 2017 costs reflect staff time in preparing for the concerts, as well as overtime costs.", "Traffic management costs for the 2017 TCS season were $50,354. The costs reflect pedestrian management activities above and beyond the regular Go With The Flow initiative, and the emergency procurement of a traffic control contractor to manage the larger-than-expected traffic and pedestrian flows.", "For other large-scale private events in the City, an event producer must pay for all costs associated with the event. In the case of the TCS, the City\u2019s General Fund\u2019s contribution last year totaled $1,255,672. The general fund contribution for TCS is in addition to the millions of dollars of investment the general fund has provided to address the Pier\u2019s capital improvement and critical infrastructure needs. Projected subsidies for the Pier\u2019s on-going capital improvement needs are estimated to be more than $1 million per year, often crowding out other capital improvement priorities considered for inclusion in the City\u2019s Capital Improvement Budget.", "Discussion", "SMPD, Fire, Beach Management, and SMPC hold multiple coordination and logistical meetings prior to each concert series, as well as debriefing meetings following each concert. During the 2017 series, SMPC focused its efforts on reducing attendance levels.  The undertaking was made more challenging by the previous year\u2019s opening of the Expo line, which has brought, and will continue to bring thousands of visitors by rail to the terminus station located a few blocks from the Pier. Reducing attendance and better managing the overflow crowds was also difficult because of the regional reach of marketing of the TCS that was managed by the SMPC and the TCS\u2019s sponsor (Snap). An interdepartmental evaluation of the 2017 series determined that in spite of full implementation of the changes designed to reduce the attendance, the changes were neither adequate, nor effective. As a result, the City received numerous complaints from residents and businesses about pedestrian and traffic congestion around the Pier and downtown, and the unprecedented number of attendees at the first concert heightened public safety concerns for the remainder of the season.  The tragedy at a music festival in Las Vegas in October, along with other events where public places have been the targets for mass casualty events has also played a role in City officials\u2019 assessments regarding the public safety concerns related to TCS.", "The costs, safety concerns, and other impacts associated with TCS have grown considerably and the City must consider whether it should continue to spend the resources to ensure public safety and adequate beach maintenance for the event to the extent it has in the past. An interdepartmental staff committee has reviewed the history of the TCS, as well as many aspects of the event during the past season (number of concerts, event timing, ability to ensure health and safety of attendees, cultural objective, crowd size, history of SMPC commitments and achievements, and SMPC staff and board transitions, etc.). As a result of the review, staff recommends a hiatus for the upcoming 2018 season to provide the SMPC and City with an opportunity to reevaluate and reformulate the concert series to reduce its safety liabilities and fiscal impacts.", "Following the proposed 2018 hiatus, staff recommends consideration of the following adjustments if a concert series is to return in 2019:", "\u00b7 scale back the size of the event so that all attendees are contained within the venue space on the Pier deck,", "\u00b7 schedule the series outside of the summer season, and", "\u00b7 discourage attendees from locating on the beach.", "Methods to lessen the number of attendees on the beach could include:", "\u00b7 removal of all speakers that project towards the beach,", "\u00b7 reduction or relocation of the size of the stage so that it is not visible from the beach,", "\u00b7 placement of physical screens on the south side of the Pier to remove views of the venue from the beach, and", "\u00b7 require that any future concert series be fully self-funding and not rely on any unreimbursed financial contributions from the City.", "The Pier and the City of Santa Monica have been fortunate to be able to host the popular, high-quality series each year for the past 33 years. But the situation has changed dramatically since the days when the future of the Pier was in doubt after severe storm damage. Today\u2019s TCS success has exceeded the hopes and expectations of the original event planners who sought to renew interest and visitation to the Pier. The Santa Monica Pier is now one of the most cherished and iconic landmarks in Southern California and draws millions of visitors a year.", "While suspending the 2018 TCS may be unpopular to many in the community and region who consider the series a cherished part of their summer tradition, a one-season hiatus, rather than a complete cancellation of the event, would provide the City, community and the SMPC with adequate time to plan and consider an alternative event program. SMPC would be asked to return to Council in the fall of 2018 with a proposal for reimagined events (including the possibility of a reimagined TCS) that address the public safety needs and conform with all City event policies. The SMPC has committed in their work plan to produce other free summer entertainment opportunities on the Pier such as the Paddleboard and Ocean Festival in June that celebrates the city's beach culture.", "Alternatives", "SMPC Proposal (Attachment D)- At the SMPC Board meeting on November 20, 2017, the Board approved a recommendation to present Council with an alternative to a one-year hiatus.", "The SMPC proposes the following:", "\u201cKeeping the Santa Monica Pier Corporation's commitment to year-round public programming, as per our Guiding Principles, and keeping mindful of upcoming changes including the construction of the new bridge, the arrival of the Expo light-rail line, the 2028 Olympics and the increasing popularity of the Pier plus the need to work with the Pier's businesses, businesses from the surrounding area, City staff, sponsors and other partners including the Cultural Affairs Division, Downtown Santa Monica, Main Street BID, Snap, Santa Monica Daily Press and Santa Monica College, the Board wishes to move forward to provide Pier-focused, creative, interactive, cutting-edge and traditional opportunities for all demographics, with an approach of open-mindedness to ensure that the tradition of summer continues by re-imagining the concert series for a one-day transitional summer celebration, followed by a range of musical experiences in the Fall of 2018 and beyond, especially during the off-season time periods and acknowledging that this will require continuous evaluation as we prepare for future enhancements to the Pier and remain committed to the legacy of the Pier as a venue for free, inclusive cultural events.\u201d", "The event types are not yet defined but efforts would be made to be creative and Pier-focused.

Staff propose this because the use of this amount of funding would indicate that the events were on a similar scale as the TCS and the safety, security and environmental concerns have not been addressed.", "Cancellation of Series - The public safety, traffic congestion, and beach maintenance concerns of the TCS, in addition to substantial and increasing costs to the City, raise serious questions regarding whether continuation of the annual concert series is justifiable. If such concerns cannot be adequately addressed and remedied, another option is to cancel the TCS going forward and to look to other ways to achieve the goals of the SMPC.", "Community Engagement", "The Pier Board have discussed the matter at multiple public meetings, including at a general community meeting. In addition, the Santa Monica Pier Lessee\u2019s Association has also discussed the matter. Finally, the Downtown Santa Monica Inc.

Approximately 51% of those polled before the property tax amount was disclosed said they would definitely or probably support a parks bond and, after the tax amount was disclosed, only 45% said they would definitely or probably support it. A super-majority of 66.67% is needed for a GO bond measure to pass. Polling showed residents generally enjoy the City\u2019s parks, are satisfied with park maintenance and operations, and are happy with their proximity to a park. Moreover, residents value parks and would like additional open space but a sufficient number of residents do not feel enough of an urgency to develop open space or renovate existing parks to be willing to pay for the improvements.", "Staff is concerned that timing for building support for a local bond measure could be misaligned with the PRMP timeline, which was delayed several months due to staff capacity issues. Staff is also concerned bond support would be affected by apprehensions recently expressed by community members related to the increasing impacts of homelessness in the City's existing public spaces, including parks.", "Given timing and other challenges, staff recommends advancing the PRMP update and pausing on the potential parks bond measure until the City is in a better position to move forward. Without the potential bond measure moving forward at this time, construction of the 12-acre expansion of Airport Park in the near term would not proceed.", "Background", "In 1997, Council adopted the City\u2019s first Parks and Recreation Master Plan (PRMP) and a new Open Space Element of the General Plan (Attachments A and B). Since the PRMP was adopted in 1997, the City has accomplished many of the PRMP\u2019s strategies including expanding the community park system, reinvesting in and revitalizing existing parks, improving and expanding sports and recreation facilities, and enlivening parks with cultural facilities. Furthermore, other related master and specific plans have been approved since adoption of the PRMP, such as the Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE), Downtown Community Plan, Urban Forest Master Plan, Bicycle Action Plan, and Pedestrian Action Plan.", "The PRMP intended to guide improvement of the City\u2019s park facilities for 20 years (through 2017) and a comprehensive process is needed to ensure the plan is updated to align with the City\u2019s dynamic urban landscape and evolving resident demographics. Preparation of an updated PRMP would assess current parks, recreation, and open space needs and plan for future need. As discussed further below, a significant number of projects in the 1997 PRMP have been accomplished but there are still initiatives left to complete. These projects, in addition to the growing need and demand for open space citywide, necessitate a broad analysis of park operational and usage models as well as innovative funding strategies to support their implementation.", "The City\u2019s park inventory currently provides 1.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, well below the Los Angeles County average of 3.3 acres per 1,000 residents, as determined by the Los Angeles County Comprehensive Parks Needs Assessment completed in May 2016 (Attachment C). This metric does not include the 245 acres of Santa Monica State Beach. Exploring funding strategies to support both the capital investment in parks and recreation facilities as well as continue to meet operating needs is becoming increasingly more challenging due to a growing number of high priority City projects competing for limited funding in each Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Biennial Budget. On April 25, 2017, in response to this budgetary pressure and a demonstrated need for funding to support projects such as the expansion of Airport Park, Council directed staff to explore a potential local GO bond measure that could be considered for the November 2018 ballot (Attachment D).", "Discussion", "PRMP Accomplishments", "Since adoption of the PRMP in 1997, the City has added a total of 23.5 acres of parkland through the development of Airport, Euclid, Tongva, and Ishihara Park, Ken Genser Square, the expansion of Virginia Avenue Park, and the incorporation of the Ocean Park Green Space into the park inventory. Dog parks were created at Pacific Street, Joslyn, and Airport Park and community gardens were added on Main Street and at Euclid and Park Drive Park. Additionally, park renovations, playground enhancements, and building improvements were completed at Clover, Douglas, Marine, Joslyn, Memorial, Ozone, Palisades, and Reed parks. The City and the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District collaborated to create the Playground Partnership program, which allows public use of elementary school playgrounds during non-school hours, and developed the award-winning Santa Monica Swim Center on the Santa Monica College (SMC) campus. There are also several park projects currently underway including the Civic Center Sports Field (approximately 2 acres), the 12-acre Airport Park Expansion, Clover Park restrooms replacement, and the Memorial Park master plan and expansion to include the 2.9-acre former Fisher Lumber site.", "The City has also accomplished notable projects at Santa Monica State Beach since the 1997 PRMP was adopted, including the development of accessible walkways to the water, construction of a Universally Accessible Playground in South Beach, development of the Beach Green, restroom building replacements, development of Slackline Park, and completion of the Annenberg Community Beach House on the former Marion Davies Estate. Numerous improvements also have been made to Beach parking lots and signage improvements along the Beach Trail. Other projects in the pipeline include the North Beach Playground, expected to open in 2018, and the North Beach Trail Improvements project currently being designed.", "PRMP Update RFP and Contract Award", "The completion of the aforementioned projects marked significant progress towards achieving the objectives set forth in the 1997 PRMP. Now it is time to plan for the next 20 years and beyond by building on the needs identified in the Los Angeles County Comprehensive Parks Needs Assessment, and aligning where appropriate with other planning documents such as the LUCE, Downtown Community Plan, Urban Forest Master Plan, Bicycle Action Plan, and Pedestrian Action Plan. To do so, RFP #130 was issued on August 10, 2017 for a consultant team to lead the PRMP update including designing and facilitating a robust community engagement process; interfacing with an ad hoc committee of the Recreation and Parks Commission; determining possible ways to approach planning for the future conversion of the Santa Monica Airport (SMO) to open space; and assessing budgetary needs and strategies to identify a comprehensive set of funding sources to support future parks and recreation development to meet the needs of the community.", "The RFP closed on September 14, 2017 and six proposals were received, ranging in cost from $149,999 to $691,700. Staff from the Community and Cultural Services, Public Works, and Planning and Community Development departments evaluated the proposals and shortlisted and interviewed three consultant teams. Staff selected MIG Inc. as the best qualified firm based on team composition; relevant experience with similar projects, including municipal park master plans for Palo Alto, Irvine, Pittsburgh, and San Jose; knowledge of and familiarity with the Santa Monica community gained from leading the Land Use Circulation Element (LUCE) update and the Santa Monica Pier Community Visioning process; and total proposal cost. Staff recommends awarding the PRMP update contract to MIG in the amount of $488,706 including 10% contingency. MIG expects the PRMP update process will take approximately 18 months from project kickoff in January 2018 to plan adoption in June 2019.", "Funding Considerations", "One of the most significant objectives of the PRMP update is to inform budget planning and forecast future financial needs. An increasing number of high priority, citywide projects compete for a limited amount of funding in each CIP Biennial Budget cycle and, while parks and open space development and improvement historically has been generously supported by the General Fund, there are unfunded park projects in the pipeline. The most immediate need is funding for construction of the Airport Park Expansion project. On March 24, 2015, Council directed staff to develop 12 acres of non-aviation land adjacent to the existing Airport Park, with a focus on sports fields, and to do so as quickly as possible. On January 26, 2016 following an RFP process, Council authorized entering into a contract with Rios Clementi Hale Studios for the design of the Airport Park Expansion project (Attachment E). The current estimated cost to construct this project is approximately $30 million, including forecasted cost escalation, construction management, direct owner costs, and 10% contingency. A funding source would need to be identified before a Request for Bids (RFB) for a contractor could be issued.", "It is important to note that since Council\u2019s directive to move forward with the Airport Park Expansion project, the City entered into a Consent Decree with the federal government that allows the City to close SMO in 2028, paving the way for the airport to be converted to a great park. (Measure LC approved by voters in November 2014 limits the development of SMO land to parks, public open spaces, and public recreational facilities, as well as the maintenance and replacement of existing cultural, arts, and education uses. Development of SMO land for other uses is not permitted until voters have approved limits on the uses and development that may occur on the land.)Council also approved and allocated funding for design and construction of a new multipurpose sports field at the Civic Center (Attachment F). This project is currently in design development and is expected to be completed by March 2021.", "Another important and long-awaited park project in the pipeline is the expansion of Memorial Park. The City acquired the 2.9-acre Fisher Lumber site in 2004 for the purpose of expanding Memorial Park. Funding in the amount of $1.35 million was appropriated in the FY 2016-18 CIP Biennial Budget for the development of the Memorial Park Master Plan, with an additional $300,000 planned in FY 2018-19. Staff is currently reviewing and evaluating proposals received from consultants to lead the master planning process. Development of the master plan will determine the overall placement and configuration of park uses and amenities on the expanded site as well as phasing and overall budget estimates. Complete design of each phase would follow based upon funding availability. In November 2016, Santa Monica voters approved SMC\u2019s Measure V bond, which will provide up to $20 million for Memorial Park improvements. While the $20 million in Measure V funding is significant, it is anticipated that additional funding will be needed over time to support a full upgrade and expansion of Memorial Park.", "Potential Local Parks Funding Measure", "In response to budget constraints and the unfunded park projects detailed above, on April 25, 2017, Council directed staff to explore a potential local parks GO bond for the November 2018 ballot. Pursuant to this direction, in June 2017, staff worked with Goodwin Simon Strategic Research and TBWB Strategies, the City\u2019s bond outreach strategist, to conduct focus groups comprised of Santa Monica residents with demographics (age, political party, homeowner/renter status) representative of the City\u2019s voting population. The focus groups informed development of potential bond messaging as well as polling questions that were later tested with residents through telephone polling conducted in August 2017.", "The telephone polling results were not overwhelmingly favorable for the bond. Polling showed that residents generally enjoy the City\u2019s parks, are satisfied with park maintenance and operations, and are happy with their proximity to a park. It also concluded that Santa Monicans highly value their outdoor lifestyle in the City, whether it is being active in a park or at the beach, strolling through their neighborhood, or riding a bike from one corner of the City to another. Residents value the City\u2019s parks but do not feel a sufficient urgency to develop additional open space or renovate existing parks to be willing to pay for the improvements.", "Specifically, a potential bond measure for either $100 or $200 million was favored by approximately 61% of those polled (including those leaning yes) with results becoming less favorable with the same respondents at 54% after the estimated property tax impact was disclosed (see Table 1 below). These low favorability ratings do not preclude the measure from moving forward but indicate significant challenges to fostering sufficient community support to ensure a successful outcome if a local measure were to be placed on the ballot in November 2018.", "Before Tax Amount Disclosed", "After Tax Amount Disclosed", "YES", "61%", "55%", "Definitely Yes", "31%", "27%", "Probably Yes", "19%", "18%", "Lean Yes", "11%", "10%", "NO", "25%", "35%", "Lean No", "4%", "7%", "Probably No", "8%", "9%", "Definitely No", "13%", "19%", "Don't Know", "14%", "10%", "Table 1: Goodwin Simon Strategic Research Telephone Polling Results (August 2017)", "Challenges with Timing of the Potential Bond Measure", "In addition to unfavorable polling results, staff is concerned the timing for informing and educating the public on a local bond measure could be misaligned with the PRMP timeline, as well as the very real concerns being expressed by community members related to the increasing impacts of homelessness in the City's existing public spaces. Staff initially anticipated that the majority of the process leading to a PRMP update would be completed by June 2018 when Council would need to decide whether to place a local bond measure on the ballot. Due to staff capacity limitations and competing priorities, the PRMP process was delayed and the first public draft of the plan is now expected to be completed in March 2019.", "The PRMP update would map a path for project prioritization and inform new strategies for open space use, operations, and funding. For example, the plan could recommend public/private partnerships in addition to or instead of a GO bond measure. Because of this, moving forward with a bond measure on the November 2018 ballot in advance of the adoption of the PRMP update does not seem prudent.", "In addition to timing and PRMP alignment hurdles, the current community climate could prove to be a challenging environment within which to foster financial support for open space. Telephone polling results showed approximately 16% of respondents indicated homelessness is the first thing that comes to mind when they think of Santa Monica\u2019s parks. This could cause residents to be apprehensive about supporting a parks funding measure in 2018. The City is investing in new strategies for proactive engagement in public spaces as a component of the City\u2019s response to the homelessness crisis, yet homelessness is a regional issue and the regional service system has not scaled in step with the rapid growth in the population. It will take time, locally and regionally, to develop a service and housing system that can meet today\u2019s needs. In the meantime, homeless people will continue to congregate in public spaces, which may continue to fuel a negative perception of the City\u2019s parks.", "Furthermore, while bond polling did not evaluate resident support for specific sites or projects, the bond measure would come prior to decisions regarding the use of City\u2013owned land at 4th/5th Streets and Arizona Avenue, which will still be in the environmental review process with multiple alternatives under study, including using the site solely as park space. (The project\u2019s draft Environmental Impact Report is anticipated to be released in June 2018 for public review.) Some residents have expressed a sentiment about the project site that favors including a significant amount of open space, may want it included in the bond, and refuse to support it otherwise. Ideally, decisions about the site would be made in advance of the bond moving forward to minimize discord about what bond funds should support.", "Lastly, it could be favorable to add the bond measure to the March 2020 ballot instead of the November 2018 ballot, as voter turnout for the March 2020 presidential primaries is anticipated to be significant.", "Commission Action", "Presentations of the poll results were provided to the Recreation and Parks Commission on September 18, 2017 and to the Field Sports Advisory Committee on November 8, 2017. On November 16, 2017, the Recreation and Parks Commission had a second discussion regarding the poll results and bond measure timing. The Commission adopted a motion in a 4-1 vote to recommend that Council direct staff to pause on the potential park bond measure for November 2018 and focus on completing the update to the PRMP, with consideration of a potential bond measure in 2020 (Attachment G).", "Staff Recommendation", "Given timing and other challenges, staff recommends awarding the PRMP update contract to MIG Inc. at a cost of $488,706 (including 10% contingency), focus on completing it, and pausing on the potential parks bond measure until the City is in a better position to move forward.", "Alternatives", "As an alternative, Council could direct staff to move forward with the PRMP update as well as the bond-related educational outreach. TBWB has recommended that consideration be given to capitalizing on the support of Santa Monica\u2019s outdoor lifestyle by developing an educational message to educate the community on the investments the City has made to support and protect Santa Monica\u2019s outdoor lifestyle, including parks but extending to include the urban forest and the bike and pedestrian networks. The outreach would also include information about current open space needs identified through the Los Angeles County Comprehensive Parks Needs Assessment and expressed by residents in other forums, and the funding required to meet those needs.", "The outreach, which is currently unfunded, would be followed by additional telephone polling in late Spring 2018 that would indicate whether public support for the potential measure has increased. Staff would return to Council in June 2018 for a decision whether to move forward with adding a GO bond measure to the November 2018 ballot and for what amount.", "In addition to these communications and outreach strategies, TBWB recommended consideration of a smaller bond if it is determined a larger bond would likely not be approved by voters. A bond in the range of $40 \u2013 50 million might fund the 12-acre Airport Park Expansion project and support modest maintenance, repairs, and improvements across other City parks.", "Another alternative is to put forth a GO bond measure in the range of $20million, an amount which debt service would be similar to that of the current GO bond for library improvements that will be paid off in 2022, in effect maintaining the current tax rate. If approved by voters in November 2018 or in 2020, these funds could be accessed upon approval of the bond while the debt service on the bond, and therefore the tax override, would begin in 2022.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "The contract to be awarded to MIG Inc. is for an amount not to exceed $488,706. Funds are available in the Community and Cultural Services department\u2019s FY 2017-18 budget.

The transfer would ensure long-term affordability of a unique housing type while capitalizing on an affordable housing organization\u2019s competencies in owning and operating affordable housing. Pursuant to Council authorization, the Caritas Corporation and staff negotiated the proposed terms of transfer for Mountain View Mobile Home Park. The proposed terms provided in Attachment A reflect Council\u2019s direction to maintain financial viability, leverage City assistance, facilitate home ownership, and provide quality property management and resident engagement.", "Background", "Ownership Transfer", "The City acquired Mountain View Mobile Home Park (Park) in December 2000, to create opportunities to preserve affordable housing at the Park.

Affordability and Resident Protections", "Caritas would comply fully with existing restrictions (Rent Control law and Regulatory Agreement), rental agreements, and exemptions provided to residents.", "Caritas would comply with terms of the Rent Control law and existing Regulatory Agreement, including affordability restrictions at or below 120 percent of AMI and housing preferences for people who live or work in Santa Monica, and would enter into a new regulatory agreement consistent with the proposed transfer terms.", "Caritas would take ownership of the 29 rental homes owned by the City, in compliance with the one-time, temporary encroachment exemption provided by Council. The exemption protects eight existing households where the home or setback encroaches into one or more adjacent home site(s). In an effort to provide housing on the home sites that are encroached upon by existing homes or setbacks, Caritas would provide incentives to encroaching households to conform to current lot lines in the form of ownership opportunities for new homes or rehabilitation options for existing ownership. Where a resolution cannot be reached, Caritas would comply with the exemption for existing households while exploring design options for homes sized to fit on the home sites with encroachment challenges.", "2. Management Plan", "Caritas has a history of developing resident-focused communities rather than property-focused communities. Caritas attributes their connection with residents to regular town hall meetings. An initial meeting, to be held within 30 to 45 days of ownership, would introduce the Park residents to Caritas\u2019 philosophy and operating goals to provide and maintain quality affordable housing, and solicit feedback from residents about resident priorities. Caritas recognizes that each community is unique and works with the residents in each community to determine their preferences to establish an environment where residents not only feel safe but that their needs are being met through connective services, activities, and support on a regular basis. In addition to the initial town hall meeting, Caritas anticipates scheduling special topic (i.e., ownership opportunities, community area improvements) meetings to engage and provide residents with opportunities to candidly address concerns and access technical assistance.

The plan clearly identifies standards and procedures for day-to-day operations and resident engagement.", "3. Home Ownership Model", "Caritas proposes to systematically shift the focus for new occupancies and existing rentals at the Park from a rental model where residents rent their homes and the home sites, to an ownership model where residents are encouraged to own their homes and rent only the home sites. However, where existing renter households choose to remain renters, Caritas would honor the terms of the existing rental agreements.", "Caritas has analyzed the economics of manufactured-home ownership for extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. The analysis demonstrates that moderate-income and some low-income households could qualify to financially carry the cost of home ownership, while very low-, extremely low-, and some low-income households could not financially sustain the cost of home ownership or maintenance without assistance.", "Caritas has experience with counseling renters about home ownership, which includes a simple application program designed to educate and encourage home ownership. Caritas has successfully identified government funding sources that have enabled 36 households to purchase new manufactured homes at mobile home parks owned by Caritas.", "Three City-owned homes are currently unoccupied. Caritas proposes transitioning live-in management staff into two of the homes at transfer and selling the remaining home to a moderate-income household. Caritas would program all sale proceeds generated directly or indirectly from the sale of existing rental homes to financially assist with new home purchases or rehabilitation of existing ownership homes.", "4. Caritas Investment for Common Area Improvements", "Within five years of ownership, Caritas would complete improvements to the Park\u2019s common areas, estimated at approximately $800,000. Common area improvements include but are not limited to the existing office, community room, laundry facilities, premises lighting, property security, and other common area amenities as warranted. Caritas has committed to investing its own funds, not to exceed $800,000, in the form of a loan from Caritas corporate reserves toward the effort to enhance the living experience of the Park residents. The Caritas loan would be amortized over 30 years at an interest rate not to exceed five percent compounded annually, with debt service paid from net operating income.", "5. Financial Sustainability", "Historically, the Park operates at a loss of approximately $100,000 per annum due primarily to income loss from vacant home sites previously held for residents displaced by the closure of Village Trailer Park (VTP). Twelve households displaced from VTP moved into the Park by 2015, reducing the number of vacant home sites from 36 to 24.", "Caritas would decrease the number of vacant home sites progressively by an average of at least two home sites per year until 100 percent occupancy is achieved. Increasing revenues from occupied home sites, combined with decreasing property management expenditures through shared economies of scale gained from Caritas\u2019 20 mobile home parks, would improve the Park\u2019s financial stability.", "Caritas understands that City ownership has exempted the Park from property taxes and that the exemption would expire upon transfer, potentially increasing operating expenses. However, a property tax exemption may also be available to the Park under Caritas\u2019 ownership for housing primarily occupied by lower-income households. Based on Caritas\u2019 experience with acquisition of 20 mobile home parks, there is typically a transition period during which residents agree to voluntarily complete income verifications to pursue a property tax exemption for a park. Caritas has demonstrated success in gaining 100 percent cooperation from 3,665 households in its portfolio, and is confident that their approach will garner equal success at the Park.", "Caritas conservatively projects financial stabilization within five years of ownership, consistent with their acquisition experience at other mobile home parks.", "6. Housing Trust Fund Loan", "Caritas has demonstrated that the economics of the Park at transfer would not sustain a combination of negative operational cash flow and debt service for the $800,000 capital loan without prudent cash reserves. Under the proposed terms, Caritas would receive a one-time, $500,000 operating reserve loan from the City to cover year-by-year operating losses. The City loan would convert to a grant pursuant to satisfaction of performance objectives described below. Theproposed loan would cover operating losses as warranted for the first five years to be disbursed on an annual basis, not to exceed $100,000 per annum. Caritas would forfeit any undisbursed portion of the loan at the end of five years. The proposed loan would be secured by a Deed of Trust, Regulatory Agreement, and an Option Agreement enabling the City to take title to the Park for $1 at the expiration of the affordability covenant.", "The loan would automatically convert into a grant at the end of seven years if total home site occupancy at the Park increases from the existing count of 81 occupied sites to 94 occupied sites within the first seven years of ownership (at an average rate of two additional occupancies per year). Currently, there are 13 vacant home sites readily available for new homes and 11 home sites with encroachment challenges.", "7. Priorities for Use of Net Cash Flow", "Caritas\u2019 ownership is projected to achieve financial stabilization within five years, with net cash flow prioritized for preserving affordable housing at the Park. The order of priority for net cash flow is as follows:", "a. Pay 50 percent of annual net cash flow toward repayment of the City loan;", "b. Assist with new home purchases or rehabilitation of existing ownership homes; then", "c. Accumulate a minimum of $500,000, above and beyond capital reserves for the benefit of the property.", "Use of net cash flow after the minimum $500,000 accumulation would require City\u2019s written approval.", "Housing Commission", "On November 16, 2017 (Attachment G), staff presented a recommendation to the Housing Commission (Commission) for the City to execute transfer and loan agreements with Caritas.  The Commission supported the terms as proposed by staff for Caritas to become owner and operator of the Park.

Visually, the fence line parallels natural boundaries as Gandara trees line the fence to the north, and mobile homes line the fence to the south.", "The encroached area is approximately 8,300 square feet and directly impacts 12 home sites. Ten of the 12 home sites are currently occupied with homes placed over the property line as illustrated in Attachment E.", "Staff recommends executing an easement agreement honoring existing conditions for both the Park and Gandara. The approach allows the Park to encroach upon Gandara for as long as it remains a mobile home park subject to an affordability covenant while reserving the encroachment area for possible future Gandara use.", "Staff explored alternative options summarized below.", "Alternative 1 \u2013 Correct the Encroachment", "The first alternative would relocate the existing 10 homes in the encroachment area to available home sites within the Park. Costs associated with the alternative include site preparation of new home sites as available, relocation of homes, and housing accommodations during interim displacement for 10 households. The option would eliminate 12 home sites impacted by the encroachment, as the home sites reduced by the legal property line will be too small for home placements. Staff recommends against the alternative because of the disruption to residents, cost, and loss of existing affordable housing opportunities.", "Alternative 2 - Modify the Legal Description", "The second alternative would be to modify the legal description of the Park and Gandara to mirror the fence line, thereby permanently reducing Gandara for the benefit of the Park. Given that the Park would be transferred to a third party, staff recommends against losing long-term City ownership of the encroachment area.", "Next Steps", "With Council authorization on the negotiated terms discussed above, staff would proceed to execute disposition, loan, and easement agreements, with affordability covenants and funding conditions for execution by Caritas and the City Manager.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "The disposition and loan agreements to be awarded to Caritas Corporation are for an amount not to exceed $500,000. Funds are available in the FY 2017-18 Capital Improvement Program budget in account H049136.589000.

Refurbishing is a re-investment in one of the City's key economic engines, helping our downtown district remain competitive and continue to offer an enjoyable experience in one of our key public spaces.", "In 1989, the City and the property owners on the Third Street Promenade had the foresight to invest in creating the experiential public space including renovation of the public right-of-way and other streetscape, part of which were two public art dinosaur topiary fountains on the promenade. These sculptures are iconic fixtures in this important community gathering place. Moreover, the Third Street Promenade has become a significant contributor to the City\u2019s economic base, which makes this a prudent investment.", "Over time, the exposure to the elements, the surface finish and joints of the concrete dinosaurs are deteriorating, their surfaces discoloring, and there are water leaks. Specifically, the scope of refurbishing the dinosaurs includes: resurfacing the exterior surfaces, re-plastering the fountain basins and installing a mosaic glass-tile band above the water line, upgrading four submersible up-lights within the fountain basins, removing 12 existing planter containers on the corner pilasters, and constructing new planters along the sides of the medians and fountains.", "Staff recommends Concept Consultant, Inc., a California-based company, for the Promenade fountain and median enhancements for a total cost of $400,000 over a one-year period (including a $24,000 contingency).

Construction will last approximately four months.", "Background", "In 1989, after a two-year $10-million renovation project, the three-block-long, Third Street Mall reopened as the Third Street Promenade (Promenade). Envisioned by City officials as a place for people to gather, walk around, and enjoy outdoor cafes, restaurants, shops and live entertainment, the Promenade also included three medians, two of which included fountains and the now iconic topiary dinosaurs at both ends of the Promenade.", "The topiary dinosaurs and fountains were an instant focal point of the Promenade upon its opening, and a favorite element for residents and visitors alike. However, 30 years later these features are showing their age. Exposure to the elements, including the sun, rain, wind and moisture, as well as water leakages have eroded and discolored the once attractive finish of the red-brown, pre-cast concrete components of the medians and fountains.

The design strategy is to transition from a dominant red-brown color to a more neutral gray palette in keeping with the rest of the Promenade furnishings. Additionally, the Lithocrete Presto finish would cover up water stains and cracks.", "The interior surface of the fountain basins would be finished in a light blue hue. The current brown-and-green tone of the materials makes the water appear muddy. A lighter color, plus additional mosaic tiles above the waterline of the fountain, would give the water a more refreshing look as well as cover up existing blemishes.", "Lighting and Electrical", "The four submersible lights embedded in the fountain basins would be replaced with newer LED lights. Existing cylindrical pedestal lights and light fixtures found at the corners and ends of the medians would be removed.", "Landscaping and Planters", "In an effort to bring more greenery to the Promenade, an additional planter would be constructed on each side of the dinosaur topiaries by constructing a matching planter wall between each pre-cast pedestal on the outside of the railings. The existing fiberglass planters placed on the pre-cast pedestals would be removed and kept for future use elsewhere.", "Contractor Selection", "On June 12, 2017, the City issued RFP# SP2491 for Third Street Promenade Fountain Enhancements.

Evaluation was based on the following selection criteria: documented experience on similar projects, a portfolio of completed projects, quality and thoroughness of the proposer\u2019s work plan and timelines, and cost. Based on their response and the overall proposal, ND Development was eliminated from further consideration since their proposal and portfolio, which mostly consisted of shade structures for playgrounds, did not demonstrate the requisite experience necessary for this project. Additionally, ND Development\u2019s proposal did not identify Shaw and Sons as the subcontractor for the Presto Lithocrete component, a requirement of the design, for which an approved sole-source justification was provided in the RFP.", "On August 24, 2017, staff from DTSM, Suisman Urban Design, and City Civil Engineering Division conducted interviews with the two qualifying proposers. Following the interview, staff provided clarification on the revised scope of work to bring the construction cost within the available budget, and requested both proposers to submit a revised bid based on a reduced scope for the electrical and lighting component of the design, which were scaled-down to just the four up-lighting fixtures in the basins since those would need to be completed prior to re-plastering the basins. The remaining lighting components could be installed at a future date without affecting or damaging the work completed under this project.", "Based on the revised proposals and criteria in SMMC 2.24.73, staff recommends Concept Consultant, Inc. as the best qualified firm for this project.

The facility\u2019s regular program hours are proposed to be between 8:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Mondays through Fridays. The facility would have four classrooms and outdoor play space in the front and back yards totaling 2,598 square feet, exceeding the State minimum standard of 75 sq. ft. per child (1,500 sq. ft. total). The applicant plans to allow early drop-off from 7:30 a.m. for parents who need to maintain their work schedules, and those children must remain indoors until 8:00 a.m. (see Condition #4). Late pick-up until 6:00 p.m. may be offered.

SMMC 9.28.070 requires that all parking in the R1 District must be located in an enclosed garage, which is appropriate for single-unit dwellings but is not practical for the functioning of a childcare use. SMMC 9.28.070 also precludes using the existing front driveway for a required parking space, as this application proposes in order to provide the three required parking spaces on-site. These requirements are the subjects of two of the variances being requested.", "The third requested variance addresses a technical conflict between the Zoning and Building Codes. Although SMMC Section 9.31.120(D) anticipates allowing the Director to approve a passenger loading space on the street in front of the property, the Building Code would require extensive modifications to the sidewalk to provide full ramping for ADA access for that loading space, which would necessitate the removal of a mature street tree and impact the character of the street. To avoid this, in consultation with Mobility staff, the applicant requests to provide a short-term parking space instead of the on-street passenger loading space that the Director is allowed to approve, also on the street in front of the property. In this way, the variance facilitates a way to meet the intent of the requirement while maintaining compatibility with the neighborhood.", "In addition to City permits, childcare facilities are closely controlled by the California State Department of Social Services, which imposes its own requirements and limits the number of children based on spatial or other considerations.

The goal reflects the community\u2019s recognition that education begins prior to kindergarten. In fact, one of Council\u2019s five strategic goals adopted in August 2015, Learn + Thrive, aligns with the decades of collaboration between the City, School District, College, non-profits, and residents to foster a lifelong learning community that thrives.", "The Council has also established a Child Care & Early Education Task Force that meets regularly to actively support quality programs and access for all economic groups. Childcare is the first \u201cstep\u201d in Santa Monica\u2019s Cradle to Career initiative to support healthy development and well-being for the City\u2019s youngest residents. According to Connections for Children (CFC), a regional childcare resource and referral agency that receives funding through the City\u2019s Human Services Grants Program to improve access to quality early care, there are always low and moderate-income families seeking subsidized childcare on their waitlist. Typically, about 60% of these families are in the 90404 area code. The number changes constantly, but at recent points in time, there have been between 50 and 60 families with 80-100 children on the list. This data does not include families seeking childcare that are able to pay full tuition. There are no statistics on these families, which may be either residents or those who work in the City and desire childcare near work. CCS staff reviewing the proposed project have also noted that the applicant has outlined an operating plan that offers a full-day program, acceptance of children in need of tuition assistance, and collaboration with Connections for Children to accept families who qualify for childcare subsidies. In this way, the proposed facility particularly caters to the strongest need in the childcare network for high quality programs that accept subsidies and lower income children as participants.", "Addressing Potential Use Conflicts through the CUP and Specific Use Standards", "During the 2015 Zoning Ordinance revision, the Council implemented LUCE Goal CE9 and Policy CE9.1 to integrate childcare uses into the neighborhoods, by adopting specific use standards for compatibility and fee incentives. The Council expanded the potential locations for childcare facilities to all neighborhoods, including R1 Zoning Districts, through the discretionary CUP process. Childcare facilities are among the very few non-residential uses permitted in single-family zoning districts. The CUP requirement and Specific Use Standards, outlined in SMMC Section 9.31.120, reflect the expectation that there are potential conflicts to be addressed when allowing a childcare use in a residential neighborhood. Potential issues include daily vehicle trips and parking, noise, and the appearance and changed use of a residential home with a non-residential use. The Planning Commission\u2019s approval of the application included conditions to address these issues, as discussed further below.", "Compliance with Childcare and Early Education Facilities Specific Use Standards", "The Zoning Ordinance Specific Use Standards were developed to address the particular characteristics, needs and potential impacts of childcare uses in order to facilitate development of high quality childcare while promoting compatibility with surrounding uses. In residential zones, through the CUP process, additional conditions can be included as appropriate to reflect the specific circumstances of the proposed facility in proximity to residential uses. The CUP conditions should protect neighborhood residents while ensuring that the facility is able to operate its educational and developmental program to provide high quality childcare and early education that meet the needs of working families.", "The proposed project is required to be consistent with specific standards regulating Childcare and Early Education Facilities (SMMC 9.31.120). These standards pertain to: allowing a four-foot front yard fence, or higher with approval of a modification, to enclose a play yard; providing a minimum amount of outdoor play area space in compliance with State licensing requirements; limiting outdoor activity hours; allowing the Director to approve one required passenger loading space on the street adjacent to the facility; requiring compliance with State and other licensing requirements; and designating a neighborhood liaison to address concerns during both construction and operation of the facility. Draft conditions #2, #6, #9, #12 and #13 incorporate the Code\u2019s operational requirements.", "The specific use standards that reflect the facility\u2019s physical design include providing sufficient indoor and outdoor space as required by State law, providing a passenger loading plan, and allowing higher front yard fences than typically allowed in residential zones to enclose a play yard. The proposal complies with the space requirements and the Mobility Division has reviewed and determined that the parking and passenger loading spaces shown on the site plan comply with the Code\u2019s dimension, access and visibility requirements.", "The Planning Commission approved a modification to allow the front yard fence up to five feet in height in order to facilitate the need for the fence to be four feet in height from the interior as required by State law due to the grade differential between the street and the property. The fence would be offset by 18\u201d from the existing two-foot retaining wall at the property line, with landscaping required to soften the interface with the sidewalk. The fence height would be considered to be five feet per SMMC 9.04.050.D (Measuring Fence, Wall and Hedge Height), which states that the height of a fence located within five feet of a public sidewalk is measured from the closest point on the sidewalk. The fence would run for 29 feet along the front property line from the southwest corner. It would then turn back for 18 feet and continue at the full five foot height to the east property line. Fencing in the rear and side yards is permitted to be up to eight feet.", "State requirements for childcare facilities specify that a fence must be designed to \u201ckeep children from leaving the outdoor activity area unnoticed but will not in and of itself present a hazard.\u201d Accordingly, a fence need not be solid, but must ensure that children are not able to climb over it (see Fence/Wall Modification, below). The Planning Commission\u2019s approval requires maximum transparency within these guidelines.", "Conditions for Special Events", "Quality childcare programs promote strong communications with the children\u2019s parents. The applicant plans to hold regular Family Forums, which may be held during or outside of operational hours. These meetings gather parents who are familiar with the site and the rules for neighborhood consideration, but it is important for neighbors to receive communications about them if they are planned outside of regular operational hours. Condition #1 requires notice to properties within a 300-foot radius of the property at least one week in advance in such cases.", "In addition, Condition #5 allows the PCD Director to approve up to two events annually based on the same findings required for Temporary Event Permits for activities related to the childcare but not specifically for the families, such as a fundraising event that is typical for non-profits. Notification would be required to neighbors within a 300-foot radius of the property. A request to hold the event must be submitted at least 45 days in advance. Although the applicant has stated that at this time, they do not anticipate doing these types of events, this condition sets forth appropriate limits and conditions to avoid disruption to the neighborhood should such an event be contemplated in the future.", "Transportation/Parking", "As described above, the applicant is providing the number of automobile and short-term bicycle parking spaces that the Code requires for this use. The Mobility Division has reviewed the parking dimensions and access and the proposed bike racks, determining that they are acceptable. Passenger loading is satisfied with one on-site space and a request (by variance) to substitute an on-street short-term parking space for the second loading space, which the Code allows the Director to approve on the street adjacent to the property. The main reason for requesting this substitution is to avoid passenger loading space standards that would negatively affect the neighborhood by changing the sidewalk and requiring removal of the street tree in front of the house.", "The childcare use would introduce new weekday traffic patterns on the street in that up to 20 children would be dropped off in the mornings and picked up in the evenings Mondays through Fridays. Although some may be siblings, and some may carpool, walk or bicycle, it is inevitable that the childcare facility will result in additional trips to the location.", "The peak morning drop-off time for the childcare facility would take place between 7:45 and 8:30 a.m. Parents are required by law to bring their children into the facility and sign them in, and to sign them out in the afternoon/evening when they pick them up.", "Prior to the Planning Commission hearing, staff heard from several neighbors who expressed frustration about increased traffic on Delaware Avenue since the Exposition Line became operational last year. Their input indicates that Delaware Avenue has become a popular cut-through street during morning and evening peak hours when traffic on Stewart Avenue tends to back up. Changes to traffic patterns that have occurred since opening the Expo Line are unrelated to the current request, but are considered as an existing condition in terms of analysis of this request.", "Neighbors sharing the alley with the property expressed concern about having their access blocked by parents\u2019 cars in the mornings. A project condition (#10) requiring a drop-off and pick-up plan was developed in order to help control the additional trips to the street and alley to access the childcare facility and avoid inconvenience to the neighboring residents at these times. The drop off and pick up plan, subject to the Mobility Division\u2019s approval prior to Certificate of Occupancy issuance, requires specific assignments to all parents to use either the street or the alley, with consideration to the anticipated arrival time of each family, in order to distribute trips. Parents would need to sign an agreement to drive and park in a manner that respects and avoids inconvenience to the neighborhood. The condition also requires all parents to sign a Drop-Off and Pick-Up Agreement, agreeing to abide by its terms.", "The total number of 20 children is small enough that there is capacity between the rear loading space, the front short-term space and other nearby street parking or on-site parking spaces for parents to safely park and sign in their children. Parents do not generally bring their children to daycare all at the same time, and bringing or retrieving a child generally takes no more than 10 minutes, although it could be more if parents need to speak with staff or settle in their children. At times that staff has visited the site and observed use of street parking, it appears that the two-hour parking restriction keeps employees of nearby businesses from parking on the street, leaving ample street parking for the short-term needs of parents coming to the childcare. Based on the above, staff concludes that the proposed plan for dropping off and picking up children from the center is feasible and through its implementation, disruption to the neighborhood can be substantially avoided.", "The applicant has stated that she intends to encourage alternatives to driving to the site, although the decisions that parents make are largely out of the applicant\u2019s control. The applicant can actively encourage employees to rideshare, which could make on-site parking spaces available to meet other needs.  Condition #15 requires rideshare encouragement including transit passes and encouraging bike commuting. Condition #17 also encourages the applicant to demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made to recruit qualified staff that reside within the 90404 zip code.", "Variance Analysis: Key Findings and Justification", "Approval of the proposed Variances requires that the City Council make all nine of the required Variance findings pursuant to SMMC Section 9.42.040. All findings have been drafted to support the variances in Attachment B. Some findings of special note in considering approval of this Variance include:", "\u00b7 There are special circumstances or exceptional characteristics applicable to the property that do not apply to other properties in the vicinity.", "\u00b7 Granting of such variance will not be detrimental or injurious to the property or improvements in the general vicinity and District.", "\u00b7 Strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not including economic difficulties or economic hardships.", "\u00b7 Strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unreasonable deprivation of the use or enjoyment of the property.", "Special Circumstances or Exceptional Characteristics", "Finding 9.42.040(A) states the following:", "\u201cThere are special circumstances or exceptional characteristics applicable to the property involved, including size, shape, topography, mature trees, location, surroundings, identification as a Historic Resource, or to the intended use or development of the property that do not apply to other properties in the vicinity under an identical zoning classification.\u201d", "This finding is supported because the proposed childcare is an exceptional use in the R1 District so the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d are due to the intended use of the property. The R1 parking standards are oriented toward compatibility of single-unit uses, which is the predominant use in the zoning district. While childcare facilities are conditionally permitted, the standards do not really consider the very different functioning of parking and loading for these uses as compared with single-unit homes. Enclosing the parking in a garage is not practical for this use, and it would necessitate a very large structure in order to meet ADA requirements, which are not applicable to single-unit homes. The childcare use must accommodate three parking spaces as well as at least one loading space on the property. Use of the front driveway in a similar manner to the previous residential use, which had a driveway that could be used for additional parking, meets the needs of the use. However, as a required space, it is not permitted, which is again a special circumstance occasioned by the proposed use. The last variance, to reduce one loading space and provide instead an on-street, short-term parking space, is also justified by the special circumstance of the childcare use, which is the only such use in the district that is allowed an on-street loading space. However, the Building Code requirements for passenger loading, as opposed to short-term parking, create a special circumstance because it would compel the applicant to modify the sidewalk and provide ADA-compliant ramps that would be incompatible with the neighborhood\u2019s character, particularly because they would require removal of a mature street tree. Granting this variance addresses the conflict caused by these requirements, given the special circumstances of the childcare use.", "Not Detrimental nor Injurious to Surroundings", "Finding 9.42.040(B) states the following:", "The granting of such variance will not be detrimental nor injurious to the property or improvements in the general vicinity and district in which the property is located.", "The project provides all required parking, and one passenger loading space on-site. The Director may approve a second passenger loading space for a childcare facility on the adjacent street, but a short-term street parking space is requested in place of the on-street loading space in order to avoid the need to make right-of-way modifications that would be inconsistent with the character of the residential neighborhood street. In making this finding, it should be considered that neighborhood residents typically park their cars on front driveways, although driveways are not considered their required parking. Designating the front driveway as one of the three required parking spaces for the use supports the childcare\u2019s activity while resulting in essentially the same use of the driveway as it served for the previous use as a residence and does not substantially alter the relationship of the property\u2019s access to the street. Concerning the reduction of one loading space, with substitution of a short-term parking space, the Code already allows the Director to approve one on-street loading space in front of a childcare. The short-term space would not be injurious to the surrounding improvements in the general vicinity because it would function similarly and thus meet the intent of the Code requirement, while avoiding the interruption of the consistent, residential streetscape and street tree pattern. Furthermore, the space will be available for general use outside of the facility\u2019s operating hours. Thus, this finding can be made for all three of the requested variances.", "Practical Difficulties or Unnecessary Hardships", "Finding 9.42.040(C) states the following:", "\u201cThe strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not including economic difficulties or economic hardships.\u201d", "The strict application of the Code, requiring alley-accessed parking in a garage and prohibiting parking in the front yard setback area, would result in hardship for the childcare use, which is required to provide a total five parking and loading spaces rather than the usual two spaces needed in this district. The requirement for parking in a garage accessed from the alley, combined with ADA requirements that do not normally apply to single-family homes, would result in the need to develop a large three-car garage structure. Providing such a structure would then leave insufficient space along the 50-foot property width to provide the required refuse, recovery and recycling storage and an accessible passenger loading space. Additionally, the childcare facility might be forced to reduce the amount of play area and possibly the number of children served in order to meet all parking location and access requirements in the rear of the property in an enclosed structure.  Furthermore, the garage structure would increase lot coverage and be less compatible with the surrounding properties. Concerning the reduction of one loading space, with substitution of a short-term parking space, the Code\u2019s nomenclature that designates only a loading zone and not a short-term parking space option, would result in practical difficulties due to Building Code requirements to modify the sidewalk with ramps for ADA access that are not compatible with the single-unit residential area and not required for short-term parking. However, the short-term parking will provide equivalent service for the drop off and pick up of children at the childcare facility. Therefore, this finding can be made for all three of the requested variances.", "Unreasonable Deprivation of the Use or Enjoyment of the Property", "Finding 9.42.040(J) states the following:", "\u201cThe strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unreasonable deprivation of the use or enjoyment of the property.\u201d", "The General Plan encourages childcare and the Zoning Code conditionally permits the use in this single-family zoning district, but requires more parking than a residential use, while still within an enclosed garage. These locational requirements reflect residential needs and character, but on a typical lot such as the subject property, the requirements taken together become unreasonable for the establishment of a childcare facility. Requiring the applicant to construct a three-car garage in the rear of the property, as well as providing an ADA-compliant loading space would preclude optimal siting to meet the needs of the childcare, which deprives the applicant of the property\u2019s use, including a potential reduction in play area and enrollment. Furthermore, due to the need for one space more than the typical single-family residential use in the R1 District, allowing the additional space to be located on the existing front driveway is necessary to allow the facility to serve 20 children, making it possible to develop a viable facility. In this way, the variances in combination provide relief from the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance to avoid unreasonable deprivation of the property\u2019s use for providing childcare to the community, a use that is conditionally permitted in the R1 District.", "Neighborhood Compatibility", "In terms of form and physical appearance, the Code\u2019s CUP findings require that a childcare facility have a physical design that is compatible and relates harmoniously to the surrounding neighborhood.", "The proposed facility will utilize a structure that has been part of this single-family neighborhood for 67 years, making only minor changes to the exterior in order to comply with building code exiting requirements. Demolishing the existing garage would change the property\u2019s appearance from the alley, but would have relatively little impact on the neighborhood\u2019s appearance since it is a secondary structure not visible from the street, and surrounding properties have high rear walls. The applicant is developing a landscaping plan that creates a garden setting, with emphasis on a natural appearance in the front yard. This type of landscaping design is typical in front yards in single-family neighborhoods throughout Santa Monica and compatible with this street.", "Placement of the required third parking space, discussed above, on the driveway (by variance) would be compatible with the pattern that exists on the street because it involves minor modification to the existing front driveway and follows the neighborhood pattern. It is typical in this neighborhood to park cars on the front driveway.", "The most atypical feature of the childcare facility in relation to the surrounding street is the front yard fence, which State law requires in order for the area to be utilized for outdoor play yard space. Due to the slope of the lot, the existing front yard is raised two feet above the sidewalk level, and is held back by a retaining wall. The five-foot fence that the Planning Commission approved by modification would require some excavation of the front yard so that the interior of the fence would be no less than four feet to comply with State law. The fence would run along 29 feet of the property line and would be set 18\u201d back from the existing front retaining wall. The setback space would be used to create a bench and landscaping that softens the effect that the fence will have on the street, which otherwise is mostly free of fences.

These findings can be made because the Specific Standards for Childcare and Early Education Facilities explicitly recognize the potential need for higher front yard fences to enclose play yards that are required to meet State standards for these uses, which justifies the need for the fence. The design as conditioned is sensitive to the surroundings and therefore the fence would not be detrimental to the surrounding uses and neighborhood.", "Condition #9 would require the Director to review the materials and style of the fence prior to issuance of building permits to ensure that it has the greatest possible transparency.

As a conditionally permitted use, findings for compatibility test whether the application meets the intent of the Code section that allows its use, is consistent with the general plan, and is compatible with the neighborhood. Decision-makers and the public receive all information in a transparent manner. In this case, variances and a fence modification were also requested, requiring consideration of additional findings. In addition to staff\u2019s analysis, the hearing process provides opportunities to consider all points brought up by the applicant and any member of the public with an interest in the outcome of the decision. Often, there are both opponents and supporters of a project, as there were in this case, and all are given an opportunity to be heard, whether in writing prior to the hearing, in person at the hearing, or both.", "In this case, the appellant\u2019s opposition to the proposal and the testimony of many in the neighborhood objecting to the preschool were articulated both in writing and in person at the hearing. The Planning Commission was aware of this opposition when it made its decision. Weighing public testimony against other considerations of the project\u2019s merits and compliance with the Code and General Plan, as well as justification of the variances and fence modification, the Commissioners used their discretion and voted to approve the use.", "As a de novo hearing, the Council, like the Planning Commission, will hear all input, and will consider the statements of opposition together with the merits, findings and recommended conditions for approval. The Council must weigh the considerations of the application to provide a preschool on the applicant\u2019s property against the appellant\u2019s evidence of strong neighborhood opposition to this new use. The Council is often required to make difficult land use decisions and weighs all evidence before doing so. In terms of legal responsibility, the appellant\u2019s statement that all neighbors oppose the application does not necessitate the reversal of the Planning Commission\u2019s approval of the project.", "#2: New Traffic:", "The appellant states: \u201cTraffic and parking in Gandara Park Neighborhood have already reached unmanageable levels, with local businesses using this stretch of Delaware for parking for their employees and Waze designating our streets as cut-throughs to avoid traffic on the 10 freeway, Olympic, Exposition and Centinela.

The 50 new car trips referenced is over the full day, not during each peak period, as the proposed childcare facility is estimated to introduce a maximum of 26 trips in the a.m. period and 26 in the p.m. period. These trips would be staggered, with employees arriving at different times based on schedule and children arriving in a controlled pattern based on assigned loading place and time. Unfortunately, the City does not have recent data on this street to compare this number to the current daily trip count.", "Staff does not have any evidence to confirm the claim that Delaware Avenue is used for parking by nearby businesses.

As such, it does not eliminate existing housing stock, although it does change the use. While a preschool is a business, it is qualitatively different from typical commercial businesses. The Zoning Code includes Child Care and Early Education Facilities within the \u201cPublic and Semi-Public\u201d use classification, implying that its character is similar to a public use, such as a school. Preschools are conditionally permitted in the R1 zoning district while other commercial uses are not permitted. As such, approval of a preschool is not a harbinger of commercial encroachment. Furthermore, preschools have enrollment processes and admit a specific group of children who come regularly to the location. The use does not invite walk-in traffic or transient customers into the neighborhood.", "LUCE policies for the Pico Neighborhood focus on neighborhood character through maintenance of existing structures and adoption of development standards.

The proposed project maintains the existing structure, which is currently vacant and in need of maintenance to become habitable again. By conserving the existing home, and using it to provide a community service for the Pico Neighborhood, the proposed project is consistent with the LUCE approach to neighborhood conservation.

The most current available data on the US Census site (www.census.gov/quickfacts <http://www.census.gov/quickfacts>) for July 2016 estimates that this number has grown somewhat since this time to 4.1% of the population of 92,478, or 3,800 children under five years old.", "In noting a \u201csurplus of preschool places for city residents,\u201d the RAND study did not infer that there were too many preschools in Santa Monica, but rather that at that particular point in time, the available preschool age childcare facilities met resident needs and still had some room for nonresidents seeking childcare near their jobs in Santa Monica. The context of the statement in the RAND study was to note that high quality childcare is an important economic development tool in terms of attracting a skilled workforce. The report also contrasted the availability of preschool places with the City\u2019s lack of toddler places for ages 0-2 and suggested ways to improve access and participation as well as support development of high quality facilities.", "The significance of the two-mile radius noted in the appeal statement is unclear, as that distance encompasses most of Santa Monica and extends into the City of Los Angeles.

Of the preschool centers, 18 are located in 90404. The two closest centers to the proposed preschool are located just south of the 10 Freeway on Virginia Avenue and Pico Boulevard.", "It is generally difficult to provide accurate estimates for total childcare need as there is no central mechanism that gathers this data for the entire community. Connections for Children (CFC), a regional child care resource and referral agency that is funded through the City\u2019s Human Services Grants Program to improve access to quality early care, keeps an eligibility waiting list of lower income families looking for subsidized childcare. This list changes constantly, even daily, reflecting family circumstances for parents and many other factors. Working families eligible for subsidy often have a hard time locating providers that will accept this subsidy and offer full-time care. Of those waiting to place children ages 0-5, generally about 60% reside in the 90404 zip code, according to CFC. The City\u2019s Human Services Division, which administers City programs in support of childcare and staffs the Childcare Task Force agrees that there is a clear need for more childcare centers, such as the proposed facility, that offer full-time slots and accept subsidies.", "Notwithstanding the above discussion of childcare supply and demand, establishing that a childcare facility is \u201cneeded\u201d in the City is not a criterion for its approval. While the City adopts general plan goals and zoning regulations, individual property owners, businesses and developers initiate projects and implement development on their properties within the framework of the regulations. In doing so, applicants indicate their assessment that there is demand for the service they propose to provide. The Zoning Code may incorporate incentives for desired uses and it may prohibit or limit less desired uses. The zoning process assumes that the market will generally balance supply and demand. If an application complies with Code requirements and the findings can be made in a positive manner, the demand or need for the use is not a review criterion unless the Code contains a quota for a particular use. There is no such limitation on childcare facilities.", "#5: Does Not Meet Mandatory CUP Findings:", "The appeal statement states that findings were not made to support the issuance of a CUP, and in one place, on page 19, states that findings were not provided to support the Variances. The appeal finds fault with the report, which focused on key variance findings and summarized CUP findings and did not further elaborate on other required findings. The statement claims that the Commission \u201cdid not perform its duty to properly investigate the valid ethical, moral and legal objections raised by Gandara Park Neighborhood residents to the Preschool.\u201d", "Response: The staff report narrative summarized the approach to analyzing the request in terms of the mandatory findings of fact and highlighted key issues for Commissioners to consider, including neighborhood compatibility. The narrative discussed issues of compatibility such as noise, trips and parking, the proposed fence, and site design matters. The staff report also included attachments with more detailed information and application materials, which are also considered an integral part of the staff report. Attachment B to the staff report, the draft Statement of Official Action (referred to as the STOA), contained language for making all findings for the CUP, variances, and modification in a positive manner for the Commission\u2019s consideration. By adopting those findings with small adjustments that were read into the record, the Commission performed its legal duty to make all findings required in the Zoning Code. The final signed STOA, reflecting the decisions made on September 6, 2017, was approved at a subsequent meeting on October 4, 2017 and accepted by the applicant (Attachment F).", "The appeal statement does not specify which findings the appellant believes were not made, but the narrative indicates particular disagreement with findings of neighborhood compatibility (CUP finding #5 and Variance finding #5). The appellant indicates that a childcare use located in one of the single-family homes on the street is fundamentally incompatible with the residential uses that occupy all other properties. The appellant states that \u201cthis tiny neighborhood cannot stand to lose its right to retain its strictly R1 zoning\u201d (Appeal, p. 6), and that \u201cthe Proposed Preschool cannot be designed, located and operated in a manner that will not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the surrounding properties as required by applicable law (p. 13). These statements, and other statements opposing the project made during the Planning Commission review process, appear to indicate the appellant\u2019s contention that any childcare facility in one of the homes on this street or within the neighborhood would be incompatible and would impair the integrity and character of the district.", "While the appellant asserts that a childcare facility is fundamentally incompatible in a R1 residential district, the Council has determined that childcare and early educational uses can be compatible in a R1 District when it revised the Zoning Ordinance in 2015 to allow the use through the CUP process, and established specific use standards. Once established as a conditionally permitted land use, the finding is properly made by examining the individual request and characteristics of the proposed site development and operations to ensure that it meets the standards and intent of the Code. In this particular case, the Planning Commission considered the proposed operation serving 20 children in the existing structure, with a drop-off/pick-up plan and restrictions on hours and outdoor play in the early morning along with other specific conditions of approval and found that, as conditioned, the proposed project meets all the findings of compatibility for the CUP, variance and modification.", "#6: The Planning Commission relied on inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims within the Report and did not perform its duty to properly investigate valid legal challenges and concerns raised by Gandara Park Neighborhood residents.", "The appellant claims that the report was deficient in the following way (p. 18 of appeal statement):", "\u00a7 The Report mischaracterizes the neighbors' knowledge of the Proposed Preschool before the August 20 informational meeting hosted by the Applicant.

The hearing date was added on June 27, 2017. Although callers expressed concern and had questions, and concerns expressed at the August 20th meeting were noted in the staff report along with one letter of opposition that had been received, the level of vocal neighborhood concern increased significantly after the report was released and at the hearing. There was no intent to mischaracterize opposition to the proposal.", "\u00a7 The Report fails to provide any credible evidence for its purported justification for the school.", "o Response: Although the appellant clearly disagrees with the analysis in the staff report, the report does cover all relevant topics associated with analysis of potential impacts that may be attributable to the use. The report and findings, taken together, provided sufficient justification to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the application may be approved.", "\u00a7 The Report makes conclusory statements minimizing the impact of the Proposed Preschool on the traffic and safety of the neighborhood\u2026 Despite the obvious disruption that this business will bring to the neighborhood, the Report casually dismisses those disruptions and concludes - without any evidentiary support and often by relying on the \u201cevidence\u201d provided by the Applicant - that the disruptions will be minimal to neighborhood or solved by the \u201csolutions\u201d suggested in the Report\u2026", "o Response: Staff analysis focused on this project\u2019s potential trip generation and its effects on the neighborhood and does not either minimize or inflate the expected trips to the street from up to 20 children being dropped off and picked up five days a week, and up to six staff arriving as scheduled. The project provides the Code-required number of parking and loading (or short-term) spaces, and the conditions of approval require transit subsidies and encouragement of non-driving alternatives. Because the use is not residential, childcare staff will not be eligible for permit parking placards, so staff will not be able to use street parking for more than two hours. Street parking by parents will be for short periods that will not impact the parking supply for the neighborhood because in the mornings the neighborhood residents will be parked first and in the evenings, if loading spaces are taken, parents will use street parking for short stays only. After 6:00pm and on weekends, there will be no change from the present conditions on the street.", "To address neighborhood concerns and distribute these trips, a drop-off and pick-up plan is required as a condition of approval. With optimal utilization of front and rear loading spaces, considering the facility\u2019s maximum enrollment of 20 children, adhering to this plan can ensure that trips to the childcare avoid overwhelming the street and alley. Parents will have specific assignments and will sign binding agreements as a condition for sending the children to Untitled #1.", "\u00a7 The Report completely ignores the already impacted condition of the neighborhood \u2026 and (fails) to even mention the Traffic Plan implemented in the past by the City to keep traffic out of our R1 neighborhood.", "o Response: Staff analysis does not minimize or ignore resident concerns regarding cut-through traffic in the neighborhood. The Traffic Engineering Division has not yet studied these impacts and thus no data exists to substantiate the claims of cars using the street in the mornings and evenings that did not exist prior to the Expo Line.", "The appeal cites large projects in the pipeline in the area north of Exposition Boulevard (the Bergamot Area Plan area) as another justification to deny the preschool and states that the approval did not consider these projects. Staff disagrees that current traffic and anticipated traffic that may be generated by new commercial projects north of this neighborhood are factors for consideration in this application, which is a small-scale reuse of an existing building that is categorically exempt from CEQA and thus does not require a traffic study.", "The City\u2019s Traffic Engineering Division has confirmed that it does not have a \u201cTraffic Plan\u201d for this neighborhood. Traffic-calming measures referenced by the appellant were implemented as part of the 2004 Lantana Development Agreements, including bulb-outs and turning restriction signs that were installed in 2008. However, the Expo Line extension project did not introduce new traffic measures. At this time, further study or development of a Traffic Plan in this neighborhood is not in the division\u2019s approved budget and work plan.", "\u00a7 The Report concludes, without any evidentiary support, that the significant increase in noise from this business will not impact the neighborhood. However, a large percentage of the residents on Delaware are elderly retirees who will be home during day when this business is operating. All our elders oppose the Proposed Preschool. Our elders crave and cherish what calmness and tranquility remains in our neighborhood after years of watching new developments spring up around their home.", "o Response: The appellant does not substantiate claims that elderly residents will suffer from the sounds of children playing. The Commission staff report did state that the sound of children playing is not incompatible in a residential area, and staff reaffirms this analysis because residential neighborhoods are places for children to live, gather and play. At the Planning Commission hearing, there were seniors who voiced concern about the potential noise from children\u2019s play, and the approval is conditioned to require compliance with the Noise Ordinance, and more importantly, for the applicant to maintain a Good Neighbor policy with a contact person to address any nuisance of which they are made aware.", "Many of these same concerns were included in a 21-page letter emailed on the evening of September 5, 2017, to the Planning Commissioners and staff. Although the timing precluded inclusion of the letter\u2019s points in the Planning Commission staff report, which had already been released, Commissioners received the information and thus were able to review that information as part of their deliberations. If the Commissioners had determined that the information presented in the letter warranted additional investigation, the hearing could have been continued with direction to staff. The Commission chose not to take up appellant\u2019s suggestion to conduct further study and declined to delay their action.", "In conclusion, the Planning Commission and the public received full information about the application, the Zoning Code and General Plan, the conditions proposed to ensure compatibility between the use and surrounding neighborhood and the public hearing. Neighborhood opposition and community support were expressed using the transparent public hearing structure and a decision was made. The appellant, representing a large group in the neighborhood, has expressed ongoing opposition to allowing this type of use in an R1 neighborhood, and the above discussion has responded to the specific points, concluding with staff\u2019s recommendation to approve the application, upholding the Commission\u2019s decision.", "Community Outreach and Comments", "In the application materials, the applicant provided documentation of her communications with neighbors about proposing a new childcare center prior to purchasing the property and submitting the application (see Attachment D).", "Soon after the site was posted for the Planning Commission hearing, staff received three phone calls from neighbors expressing concerns that the proposed center would lead to loss of residential stock in this relatively small neighborhood and increase car trips on Delaware Avenue. These neighbors noted that since the establishment of the Expo Line and delays on Stewart Street when the gates close to allow trains to pass, Delaware Avenue has experienced increased cut-through traffic at certain times of day. Callers expressed concern that the facility would add trips to the street\u2019s current traffic flow at times that they stated are already becoming problematic.", "On the afternoon of August 20, 2017, the applicant, Laila Taslimi, held a neighborhood meeting at the subject site attended by 29 neighbors, as well as her design team and the co-chair of the Childcare Task Force. City staff was also present and answered technical questions about the application and hearing process. At the meeting, Ms. Taslimi and her team provided details of the site, building and operational plans and then opened the meeting to questions and comments. Ms. Taslimi explained her plan to open the center as a registered non-profit organization next year with 12 children of mixed economic backgrounds, expanding gradually to reach the maximum of 20 children.", "Meeting participants, some of whom had previously spoken with staff as discussed above, brought up several concerns about the proposed childcare facility. Some stated that they oppose the use entirely and are concerned that it would set a precedent for the replacement of single-family homes with business uses. They were concerned about neighborhood traffic and additional use of the street in the mornings and evenings. Some cited recent increasing crime, and stated that bringing the families of children served by the use would introduce more people to become familiar with the neighborhood, which may lead to more crime on their quiet street. Furthermore, they expressed that they were not favorable toward the applicant\u2019s plans to take small groups of children to Ishihara Park, which they viewed as belonging to the nearby residents. The applicant and others present noted that Ishihara Park is a public park and not highly utilized on weekdays.", "Other neighborhood participants at the meeting expressed support for having this childcare in the neighborhood to meet the needs of working parents and create a sense of community through the concept of a preschool based on economic integration and pluralistic education.", "To reduce the impact on morning and evening traffic volumes, the applicant suggested at the meeting that it would be reasonable and feasible to assign parents to specific drop-off/pick-up locations, balancing use of the front and back parking spaces.

As there are no current members, and some of the cities included in its feasibility study have joined LACCE, SBCP would likely be smaller than LACCE if it is established. This means that Santa Monica would have greater influence in decisions made by this CCA as one of the leading cities if it were to join (or take the lead on establishing a SBCP JPA). However, forming SBCP would require additional time and resources which would increase the financial exposure of the initiating city, and delay the CCA launch considerably. UCLA confirmed that the business plan and financial strategy of SBCP provides innovative recommendations on how to address energy procurement and become an advanced CCA. The ideas in the SBCP Plan could be used by Santa Monica and other cities as a model to advocate for revision of some of LACCE\u2019s early decisions if it were to join the LACCE Board, in an effort to improve the viability of the LACCE CCA and better align it with Santa Monica\u2019s stated goals.", "LACCE is operationally ready and will likely have the largest membership of the three CCA options evaluated. This may mean less influence for Santa Monica, in terms of its direct vote. However, as the potentially largest CCA in California, this option could also provide the city with greater financial stability, greater economies of scale, and a stronger voice for the future legislative and regulatory discussion that lay ahead. Given that a CCA\u2019s success must precede its ability to provide environmental benefits, LACCE\u2019s large size probably best positions Santa Monica to provide environmental benefits in the long term. Its county-wide membership also offers member cities the opportunity to collaborate, share resources, and potentially amplify their regional impact at many other levels.", "Members of large CCAs in northern California established in the past decade have tended to reach a consensus before voting, which also demonstrates that cities which join a CCA usually tend to work collaboratively rather than antagonistically and tend to share similar goals and ambitions. Even though the Los Angeles County unincorporated area represents an important share of the load, the LA County LACCE Board Director still only has one vote, unless a weighted vote is called. Based on existing CCAs\u2019 experience so far, weighted votes tend to be infrequent and, in many cases, have yet to occur at all.", "One benefit associated with greater membership is that LACCE expects energy rates to become even cheaper with each additional joining member. The LACCE Business Plan (Attachment C) notes, \u201cAs additional Cities are added, it is expected that LACCE rates will be reduced even more when compared to SCE's.\u201d", "Moreover, economies of scale and autonomy are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as they depend on the design and policies set by the CCA. Even large CCAs can empower their member cities when it comes to local decisions and investments. Finally, participation in a larger CCA would offer Santa Monica the ability to form coalitions with other like-minded cities and influence the strategy and direction of the entire CCA.", "California Choice Energy Authority\u2019s single-city option would offer Santa Monica full autonomy over rates, power mixes, and programs. However, Santa Monica would not have a vote in decisions made by the CCEA\u2019s JPA Board, including entering into power contracts. Because of this it is even more important that the values underlying the power procurement of CCEA align with Santa Monica\u2019s values. Additionally, Santa Monica would likely not benefit from the economies of scale offered by a larger CCA if it were to join CCEA. CCEA uses a restricted bank account to reduce member cities\u2019 financial risk called a \u201clockbox\u201d, which seems to be an idea appreciated by energy providers and some of the financial institutions, and should be studied further by the city or the forming CCA.", "Renewable Energy and Local Programs", "All options have the potential for Santa Monica to immediately achieve 100% renewable electricity. LACCE plans to offer a 100% renewable energy product and allows individual cities to default their customers into that product. As no decisions have been finalized for SBCP, if and when it is established the joining cities could vote to decide to offer a 100% renewable option and could vote to decide if cities have the option to default enroll their customers. As Santa Monica would have full autonomy over product with CCEA, they could choose to also offer a 100% renewable energy product.", "Joining CCEA would provide Santa Monica with complete autonomy over the financing and implementation of local programs. While a portion of revenues would be used to pay CCEA for their services, Santa Monica would have full control over the remaining revenues for local programs.", "LACCE and SBCP\u2019s JPAs will determine how to allocate budgets for local programs. Although Santa Monica would not have full autonomy over the use of CCA revenues for programs, the economies of scale offered by larger CCAs could mean that more revenues per MWh are available to finance programs.", "With LACCE, revenues will be collected through the JPA. Some of the revenues will be used for operational costs and some will be used for JPA-wide programs. While it is up to the JPA Board how to distribute revenues, it is likely that a portion of the revenues will be allocated to member governments. The portion that is returned to member governments can be used in line with local preferences. Additionally, LACCE noted that not every program will be desirable for each member, so members can pick and choose their participation in some JPA-wide programs.", "As a single-city CCA, Santa Monica would have guaranteed autonomy over revenues not needed for CCEA, any vendors or other operating costs and could decide to use those revenues to support programs.", "UCLA\u2019s study makes clear that the current most feasible option for the City to pursue at this point is to join LACCE and once on the Board attempt to influence the establishment and operation of the CCA so that it closely aligns with Council\u2019s stated goals. The single city/CCEA option is the next feasible option because it would provide the City with a significant amount of autonomy to pursue and meet its renewable energy goals, however it would also involve a significant financial and staff commitment to establish and operate it. The SBCP model is the least operationally ready option.

The average cost per ride and cost to BBB will be consistent with the pricing of the taxi-provided service.", "Average utilization of the existing taxi based service for Blue at Night has been less than four rides per weekend. The service was created in response to public comment prior to Expo opening requesting a connection for Santa Monica residents who want to use Expo to attend weekend events in downtown Los Angeles. It is unclear whether the low ridership is due to the challenges that the taxi model created, or if the demand for this service never materialized. The new Lyft based service is being launched to test whether an easy to use service generates more interest. Given the low and quite possibly fluctuating demand, a \u201cnon-dedicated\u201d fleet of vehicles is seen as more efficient than a dedicated BBB vehicle for this service.", "Big Blue Bus will explore other ways to utilize this contract option for open to the public demand response service including expansion of the span of Blue at Night service hours or days of week.

During the weekends when there is limited Expo and bus service or if a MCO is required for city business within their work run, a car is used by the operator to meet and relieve the MCO in service. The MCOs also require cars during the driver work bid process three times a year and in emergencies. The six City-owned sedans retained for use by MCOs for relief service are approaching retirement and are idle much of the time. As a result, staff requested a bid option for MCO reliefs.

After implementation of the new system, the City was able to establish electronic file feeds between the PlanSource system and the various insurance carriers. The weekly file feeds update the carriers with employee demographics and elections, which allows for more accurate billing. The file feeds provide better employee experience as carrier files are updated in real-time and ensures employees timely access to services through the insurance carriers.

Failing to meet ACA deadlines imposed by the IRS, could result in the City incurring penalties up to thousands of dollars. A change in vendors would also result in a delay of ACA reporting requirements. The ACA requires employers to report the following information every month to the IRS: identify all full time employees working 30 hours or more, determine if the minimum essential health coverage providing minimum value was offered, and if the offer was made to dependent children and spouses, and the employee\u2019s premium contribution to the lowest cost employee-only plan.

Part I considers the demands of various users of the Civic Center Parking Facility, strategies to manage supply and reduce demand, and potential locations that may absorb the parking demand within the area between Pico Boulevard and Wilshire Boulevard, including both sides of 4th Street.  Part I will produce alternative use and operational scenarios that are tested for potential effectiveness resulting in a set of recommendations for parking resource management.", "Part II of the study will analyze the availability of the City\u2019s network of beach lots to serve beach visitors, along with other means of access such as transit options and the bicycle network, in order to determine whether construction of the field and activation of the Civic Auditorium will impact coastal visitor access. In this part of the study, the consultant will build on the recommendations for implementing operational measures to manage Civic Center parking resources for local uses to add the perspective of continued coastal visitor access. The budget also provides for the consultants\u2019 participation in stakeholder outreach and City meetings.", "Consultant Selection", "On October 10, 2017, the City issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a parking study to support development of the Civic Center Multipurpose Sports Field.

Section 9.28.060, which was modified during the DCP process, eliminates minimum parking requirements within the Downtown area and also establishes a maximum number of parking spaces that can be provided. While the project proposes parking in excess of the Downtown parking maximums, the amount of parking proposed is reasonable given that the project was designed to comply with earlier iterations of the DCP. The project must include 155 parking spaces to fulfill the obligations of the private parking easements being transferred from 1337 7th Street and 1325 6th Street in their temporary and permanent conditions. In order to ensure that the excess parking is being constructed solely for the easement, the development agreement includes a provision in Section 9.1(c) that requires that the developer record a parking rights easement on the property before the development agreement becomes effective. As a result, the actual number of parking spaces being provided for the project is 141 spaces. Of that amount, 20 spaces are required to be available as non-exclusive, shared parking on a first-come, first-served basis and an additional 15 spaces are reserved as public parking for the City\u2019s use (expandable to 30 spaces upon issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the 1325 6th Street development agreement). At an end state, there would be 91 spaces that could be exclusively used for the project\u2019s residential and commercial tenants or could also be shared with off-site users. This is a reasonable number to provide opportunity for a necessary transition to eliminate parking minimums in the Downtown area. Section 2.8.14 of the DA includes flexibility for the applicant to use no more than 191 parking spaces for on-site or off-site residential and commercial users, which is consistent with the policy direction to provide property owners more flexibility in the management of parking resources.", "Affordable Housing Requirements", "The applicant proposes to comply in principle with Chapter 9.10 of the Zoning Ordinance, which establishes affordable housing requirements for Downtown housing projects.

The proposed project has a floor-area ratio (FAR) of 3.1. As proposed, the residential mixed-use project is within the maximum allowable height (60 feet) and FAR (3.5) for a Tier 2 project in this zoning district. As a Tier 2 project, the proposed development is subject to an Administrative Approval Permit with specified project requirements in Section 9.10.070 of the Zoning Ordinance and Section 9.10.060 of the Downtown Community Plan. However, the applicant has proposed a Development Agreement due to excess parking spaces proposed on-site that will serve to replace parking spaces that are currently obligated by a private parking easement at 1337 7th Street, a site that is part of the property exchange between the City and NMS Properties where the City is seeking to acquire 1337 7th Street for the purposes of developing a new Fire Station No. 1. Project development compliance is limited to the Downtown Community Plan, however, Section 9.10.110 of the Downtown Community Plan allows for negotiated modifications to any standard, except for height and FAR.", "The proposed unit mix consists of 9 studio units (14%), 32 one-bedroom units (50%), 13 two-bedroom units (20%), and 10 three bedroom units (16%). Affordable housing requirements for Downtown housing projects are established in Section 9.10.070 of the Zoning Ordinance, which authorizes development agreements complete prior to November 16, 2016 to provide 25% of the total units in a project as off-site deed-restricted units subject to a prescribed mix of affordability levels. The project proposes 15 off-site affordable housing units (23%) to be located at 711 Colorado Avenue, which is proposed to be a 45-unit 100% affordable senior housing project. The 15 units would consist of a minimum of seven (7) units to be affordable to 30% Area Median Income (AMI) households and an additional 8 units affordable to 100% AMI households. In addition to satisfying the affordability requirements of this Development Agreement, 711 Colorado Avenue is also intended to satisfy the affordable housing obligations for the Development Agreement at 1430 Lincoln Boulevard. The proposed Development Agreement stipulates that the affordable units must receive their Certificate of Occupancy before the market rate units receive their Certificate of Occupancy.", "The applicant is also requesting a time period of five years after the development agreement\u2019s effective date for a building permit to be issued for the project. The time period is longer than typical but is warranted given that the surface parking currently at the site is obligated by a 43-space private parking easement in favor of the building at 1314 7th St. Therefore, the surface parking on the subject property must remain until temporarily moved to the 1430 Lincoln Boulevard project, after its completion. The 1430 Lincoln Boulevard project is expected to be completed by 2023. When the proposed project is completed, the 43 parking spaces would permanently be moved back to the project site.", "Background", "The project site consists of a 100\u2019 x 150\u2019 lot totaling 15,000 square feet in size that is located on the east side of 6th Street between Santa Monica Boulevard and Arizona Avenue. The site is currently developed with a surface parking lot that is for private use only and is not available to the general public, as shown in Figure 1 below.", "Figure 1: Existing Site Conditions - 1325 6th Street", "Adjacent uses consist of a three-story office building to the north, the Santa Monica Main Public Library to the south, the YMCA to the west, and a five-story office building to the east. The project site is less than a half-mile walk from the Santa Monica Place and the EXPO light rail terminus station at the corner of 4th Street and Colorado Avenue.", "The Development Agreement application was submitted to the City on May 3, 2012, for a 7-story, 100-unit residential mixed-use project with 2,400 square feet of ground floor commercial over four levels of subterranean parking. The processing of the project was placed on hold due to the project exceeding the 6-story limit in the 1984 LUCE and the unit mix not qualifying for the priority processing requirements established by the City Council. Revised plans were submitted to the City Planning Division in November 2015, for a project reduced in size, massing, and density consisting of 6-stories and 65 residential units. Plans were then further revised and submitted to the City in March 2016, in response to comments received from the City Planning Division related to general design issues, and noncompliance with the Zoning Ordinance and Downtown Community Plan standards.", "This development agreement application has been reviewed consistent with the public process including a community meeting, ARB concept review, Planning Commission float-up review, and Planning Commission formal consideration. The Planning Commission float-up comments are outlined in Attachment E.", "Planning Commission Action", "The Planning Commission reviewed this development agreement on October 4, 2017 and discussed why the project was proposing more parking than the maximums established in the Zoning Ordinance for Downtown and why more of the project\u2019s parking could not be transferred into public shared use (i.e. first come, first serve) instead of being reserved for project tenants. While acknowledging the rationale for extra parking in the project to honor existing parking easements on the project site, some Commissioners were concerned that the excess parking was a departure from the Downtown Community Plan elimination of parking minimums and establishment of parking maximums. The Commission also discussed extending the time period to 75 years for the affordable housing deed restriction as a trade-off for the fact that the off-site affordable housing project at 711 Colorado will be operated by the developer instead of a non-profit housing provider. Finally, some Commissioners raised concerns about the City entering into a development agreement with the developer given knowledge of outstanding business and legal disputes. Staff provided a summary of findings of an assessment for Council that found NMS Properties in current compliance with all City obligations (Attachment H).", "The Planning Commission voted 5-2 to recommend that the City Council adopt the proposed Development Agreement with the following DA modifications:", "1. Larger elevators should be included so that bicycles can be more easily accommodated.", "2. Remove Condition of Approval #3a that the Architectural Review Board pay special attention to the north wall to add visual interest in order to avoid a blank wall (the Commission felt that the wall would not be visible from the public right-of-way).", "3. Add a historic preservation contribution of $75,000 to the DA.", "4. Double the affordable housing commercial linkage fee proposed in the DA to approximately $600,000 to account for the modification to Downtown affordable housing requirements in terms of affordability mix, income/rent limits, and operator of the off-site affordable housing.", "5. Increase the amount of public shared parking (i.e. first come, first serve) in the project by 37 spaces.", "6. Extend the deed restriction term for the off-site affordable housing at 711 Colorado Ave. to 75 years (the typical term is 55 years).", "The applicant has agreed to increase elevator size to better accommodate bicycles, will provide a $75,000 contribution toward historic preservation, and agrees to extending the term of the affordable housing deed restriction at 711 Colorado Avenue to the greater of 75 years or the life of the project. The applicant is not agreeable to increasing the affordable housing commercial linkage fee and the number of shared parking spaces.", "The proposed project is compliant with height and FAR for a Tier 2 Downtown housing project and would otherwise be processed as an Administrative Approval except for the excess parking spaces that will serve to permanently replace parking spaces that are currently obligated by a private parking easement at the subject property. Therefore, since a DA is only necessary for these parking spaces, the applicant believes the increased fee is unwarranted.", "With respect to increasing the number of public shared parking spaces by 37 space, the applicant believes that these spaces may be needed for the on-site commercial and residential uses. If these spaces are not needed for the project, they could be made available to off-site uses.", "Further, staff recommends keeping the ARB provision for the north wall because, as presently designed, the exposed blank wall is visible from the public right-of-way, especially when viewed from 6th Street. In the DCP design standards, interior side elevations of buildings are required to be modulated for 15% of the exposed fa\u00e7ade above 39 feet. As a fundamental design principle, the ARB has typically required that architectural concepts are consistently executed throughout all elevations of a building.", "Project Analysis", "Project Description", "The proposal consists of a 6-story, 60-feet high, 46,124 square-foot residential mixed-use building with 4 levels of subterranean parking containing 138 parking spaces. The subject site is located within the Neighborhood Village zoning district. The design includes 6,557 square feet of commercial floor area on the ground floor (including 1,697 square feet of outdoor dining area), and 36,764 square feet of residential floor area on the upper levels. The project site is 15,000 square feet of lot area for an overall floor-area ratio (FAR) of 3.1. As proposed, the residential mixed-use project is within the maximum allowable height (60 feet) and FAR (3.5) for a Tier 2 project in the NV district of the DCP. As a Tier 2 project of less than 75,000 square feet, the proposed development is subject to an Administrative Approval permit and project requirements established in Chapter 9.10 of the Zoning Ordinance. A development agreement is being proposed by the applicant due to the excess parking spaces proposed in the project that will serve to permanently replace parking spaces that are currently obligated by a private parking easement at the subject property. The processing of the project as a development agreement allows the inclusion of performance obligations from both parties involved in the Fire Station No. 1 property exchange and ensures that protective measures are in place for its effectuation that could not otherwise be included as part of an Administrative Approval.", "The ground floor frontage of the building is made up of a residential lobby with 4,860 sq. ft. of indoor commercial space (adjacent to a 1,697 sq. ft. outdoor dining area) that provides pedestrian access directly from the sidewalk and along public open space area along the south side of the building. The remainder of the ground floor area is made up of building support areas such as transformer, generator and electrical rooms, loading area and refuse/trash staging area. There are also two, 2-bedroom units at the southeast corner of the first floor which are accessed from the open space along the south side of the building. The upper floors (2-6) include additional residential units with single-loaded and double loaded corridors and an extensive roof deck area with spa for use by the residents that is approximately 2,649 sq. ft. in size. The roof plan also identifies space allocated towards solar panels. Vehicular access to the subterranean garage is provided from the 6th Court alley at the rear of the site.", "Figure 3: Proposed Project Looking East on 6th Street.", "The project\u2019s residential component consists of 64 residential units with the following unit configuration:", "Table 1: Project Unit Mix", "Unit Type", "Number of Units", "Percentage", "Studio", "9", "14%", "1 Bedroom", "32", "50%", "2 Bedroom", "13", "20%", "3 Bedroom", "10", "16%", "\uf0a7 Total Project Average Bedroom Factor = 1.38", "The proposed unit mix satisfy the minimum unit mix and average bedroom requirements in Chapter 9.10 of the Zoning Ordinance as part of the required community benefits for Downtown Tier 2 projects. The proposed unit mix results in a 1.38 average number of bedrooms for all of the market-rate units, which exceeds the minimum 1.2 average required.", "Project Design and Pedestrian Orientation", "The proposed building design is modern/contemporary with high levels of glazing and transparency along the ground floor. The building is setback to provide additional open space on the ground floor, resulting in a sidewalk width that exceeds 15 feet (curb to building) along the entire property frontage, consistent with the building frontage standards of the DCP. The entire ground floor frontage is proposed for commercial uses, consistent with the Downtown Community Plan, and both commercial spaces are designed in compliance with the pedestrian-oriented standards that limit the amount of continuous blank street-level frontage and include composition of openings and building frame to provide pedestrian access directly from the sidewalk.", "Figure 4: Proposed Project Looking from the Southeast on 6th Street.", "The ground floor design incorporates glazing along the entire street wall height for a significant portion of the commercial building frontage. The ground floor public open space area is directly adjacent to the sidewalk and wraps around the south side of the building for approximately 100 feet providing seating and dining opportunities. Commercial entrances are proposed along the street frontage, as well as adjacent to the public open space area along the south side of the building for direct interaction and relation to the commercial tenant spaces. Street wall height along the building frontage exceeds the minimum 11 feet required in the DCP with a ground floor-to-floor height of 19 feet in the commercial spaces.", "As shown in Figure 3, the commercial space relates to the street in an angular fashion that provides modulation along the frontage and differentiation between the pedestrian and residence entrances.", "As shown in Figure 5 below, the commercial space relates to the street in an angular fashion that provides modulation along the frontage and differentiation between the pedestrian entrances. Additionally, the demising wall shown on the ground floor plan is purely speculative and the commercial floor area can be subdivided several different ways. The proposed street wall height along the building frontage exceeds the 11-foot minimum and 16-foot maximum ground floor-to- floor height with a proposed height of 19-feet for the ground floor commercial spaces.", "Figure 5: Ground floor plan", "Building Mass and Modulation", "The proposed height of the building is 60 feet in height, which is consistent with Tier 2 limits established for the NV District in the DCP which allows up to 60 feet. The building fa\u00e7ade is modulated at the ground level with the two building masses separated by a 25-foot wide gap that extends from podium to sky. The building frontage is also setback from the front property line and oriented at an angle to the street. The street frontage of the two commercial spaces at the ground floor total approximately 77 feet, which equate to a total of 87% of the ground floor street frontage occupied with building volume.", "The DCP addresses building volume of upper floors; however, it approaches the reduction of upper level massing differently than what is prescribed in the Zoning Ordinance. The DCP regulates building massing by requiring a percentage of the upper level building fa\u00e7ade area to be modulated. For districts with a 60 feet height limit, the minimum required stepback above the ground floor and 39-feet shall be 15% of the front fa\u00e7ade area and be set back a minimum of 5-feet in depth from the building frontage line. Above 39 feet, the front fa\u00e7ade must be set back a minimum of 5-feet for 35% of the front fa\u00e7ade area. The proposed design complies with these requirements. Specifically, the upper levels of the street frontage provide a significant amount of modulation with varying insets and architectural features that provide a high level of visual interest. As shown in Figures 4 and 5 above, the upper levels of the building are separated between the 3rd and 6th floors by about 16\u2019 and the 3rd floor podium level features common open space. The north and south sections of the 4th through 6th floors are connected by bridges. The mass of the building at the south elevation features a similar treatment of the ground floor and upper floors. The north side elevation will be adjacent to an existing 3 story building and does not have the same treatment. The standards for the interior side elevations call for a minimum 5-foot setback from the side property lines for 15% of the exposed side interior building fa\u00e7ade area above 39 feet. The north elevation does not provide the stepbacks equaling 15% of the fa\u00e7ade required in the DCP above the ground floor. The north fa\u00e7ade is an area that staff recommends for further study by the ARB, as set forth in Condition of Approval #3a.", "Open Space", "As the project\u2019s lot width is 100 feet, the Downtown Community Plan requires that 20% of the buildable area of the project be provided as open space, with a minimum of 10% on the ground floor or podium levels and the remaining 10% without a regulated location. A total of 25% must be common open space (25% provided). The project proposes 9,415 square feet of open space, which is 20.4% of the buildable square footage. The common open space includes:", "\u2022 2,676 sq. ft. on the third floor podium deck; and", "\u2022 1,280 sq. ft. in the roof deck.", "Private open space totals 4,064 sq. ft. with a minimum of 60 sq. ft. in balconies and ground level patios.", "Parking | Vehicular Access", "The four-level subterranean garage is currently designed with vehicular access from 6th Court alley.

The third level contains parking spaces for guests and residents and the fourth level has parking for residents only.", "At the time the project was conceived, the amount of proposed parking was based upon earlier iterations of the DCP that had reduced parking requirements compared to the Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time. Section 9.28.060, which was modified during the DCP process, eliminates minimum parking requirements within the Downtown area and also establishes a maximum number of parking spaces that can be provided. The project must also provide 43 parking spaces to fulfill the obligations of an easement that was recorded on the property in 2012 in favor of private off-site users (referenced herein as the \"6th Street Parking Easement\").", "As shown in Table 2 below, the project is proposing 138 parking spaces, which consists of 95 parking spaces (77 residential, 18 commercial) for the project and 43 parking spaces reserved for the beneficiaries of the 6th Street Parking Easement. Of the 95 parking spaces, 20 spaces are required to be available as non-exclusive, shared parking at all times on a first come, first serve basis. This leaves 75 spaces, which may be used for on-site or off-site residential or commercial uses.

The 711 Colorado Avenue project will also be satisfying the off-site affordable housing obligations of the development agreement at 1430 Lincoln Boulevard, which is proposing 100 market-rate units. Together, both projects result in the production of 164 market rate units. While the percentage of affordable units for the 1325 6th Street development agreement is below the 25% established in Chapter 9.10, if viewed in the collective, the 45 affordable units in the 711 Colorado Avenue project results in 27% of total units being affordable (i.e. 45 affordable units out of 164 market rate units).", "A component of the 100% affordable senior housing project includes a partnership with the City to engage and fund a non-profit group (Wise & Healthy Aging) to operate and manage the social service and needs components of the project\u2019s resident population.

The City has a long history of developing compassionate policies and engaging in collaborative and innovative programs to address homelessness that have positioned the Santa Monica community as a leader in effective strategies to reduce homelessness. These efforts, memorialized in the City\u2019s Action Plan to Address Homelessness (Attachment J), led to a significant reduction in 2010 and sustained stable numbers until this year. However, a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in Los Angeles County has spurred a similar increase locally. This surge has not only raised the number of homeless individuals in our midst, but included a disturbing change in the incidence and severity of untreated mental illness, substance abuse and anti-social behavior among the homeless population. This has eroded our community's sense of Santa Monica as a safe and desirable place to live, play, and do business. The increased pressure on community open spaces has elevated public concern, impacted quality of life, and made clear that homelessness is a crisis that demands a community-wide response, built on a history of successful policies and programs.", "In August 2015, considering all of the issues that influence community wellbeing, Council established taking a leadership role in regional efforts to address homelessness as a top five Strategic Goal. Council clearly identified that continued local success would be contingent on broadening participation in regional partnerships. There was a recognition that Santa Monica cannot solve this issue in 8.3 square miles and it was imperative to increase capacity of the Los Angeles homeless service system to address homelessness. In fact, both the City of Los Angeles and the County of Los Angeles have subsequently stepped up in a major way, going to voters to significantly increase resources devoted to permanent supportive housing and homeless services. Residents countywide voted by 67% to support Measure H while Santa Monica voters approved the measure by 77%.", "In affirming the City\u2019s commitment to actively engage in regional partnerships with City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, staff, working as a strategic goal team, created the Homeless Strategic Goal Action Plan. The Action Plan is the City\u2019s framework for new local strategies to positively impact community wellbeing, tied to the County of Los Angeles\u2019 Homeless Initiative. The Action Plan drives towards the Wellbeing outcomes of Place as well as Community and Economic Opportunity.", "The proposed Action Plan focuses on pro-active engagement, smart deployment of local resources, use of data, technology and analysis, expanding housing options, calls for new service models and new approaches to supporting community safety through outreach, engagement, enforcement, activation, and additional staffing. Strategies are already in motion. The Homeless Multidisciplinary Street Team, Ambassadors in Tongva and Palisades Park, and homeless outreach in the Main Library, are new models demonstrating efficacy and producing positive results. To continue making progress, the City is re-tooling its approach to homelessness, expanding efforts that focus on \"where\" (highly impacted public spaces) to complement existing strategies focused on \"who\" (Santa Monica program eligible individuals). To support this broader approach, last month Council set aside $1.4M in FY 2016-17 year-end General Fund savings to design and implement new homeless outreach teams, develop comprehensive place-based strategies, and increase capacity for the Library to address the effects of homelessness. Santa Monica Police Department is maximizing existing resources by jump-starting new approaches including enhancing officer training, re-deploying existing officers to high-impact areas and expanding the Homeless Liaison Program (HLP) Team.", "This work cannot be done by the City alone; the community is poised to support and participate in new strategies in response to this changing environment. Staff are creating new ways to improve communication between the City and the community on solutions and partnership opportunities, including a public education campaign, a homelessness steering committee, and a series of public safety listening meetings currently underway. The City secured $70,000 in LA County Measure H funds, through United Way of Greater Los Angeles, to design a flexible training curriculum for City staff, businesses and residents to safely and effectively interact with homeless members of the community.

Santa Monica\u2019s Homeless Count found 921 individuals on streets and in shelters. This represents a 26% increase over the prior year. This finding is a symptom of the 23% increase in homelessness reported in the 2017 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, now a total of 57,794 people. Unlike other large urban areas across the nation, 74% of LA County's homeless population is unsheltered, with 42,828 people counted as street homeless.", "The size of the regional homeless population and local impacts of street homelessness are of serious concern across Santa Monica. Until the most recent results, year over year data since 2009 demonstrated that the City\u2019s approach to serving the most vulnerable long-term homeless individuals in Santa Monica had been effective in maintaining an overall reduction in street homelessness. However, continued local progress is dependent on the Los Angeles regional homeless service system also making strides in reducing homelessness.", "Homelessness as Strategic Goal", "In 2015, Council identified taking a leadership role in regional efforts to address homelessness as one of its five priority Strategic Goals. Council directed staff to broaden the City\u2019s focus toward engaging City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County partners to more rapidly implement services and build permanent supportive housing on the Westside. In step with the increased regional focus, the City's strategic goal team is working to connect this broader, regional perspective with measurable local results on community wellbeing related to Place by focusing new efforts in public spaces as outlined in the strategic goal team\u2019s Action Plan (Attachment D). The Action Plan is a living document constructed to be flexible and iterative. Plan concepts and strategies will evolve over time as models are deployed and evaluated, and to respond to changing environmental factors. Council approving the allocation $1.4 million in one-time funds at the October 24, 2017 meeting supports the Action Plan strategies to pilot new outreach and engagement efforts in parks and at the Library in response to the growth of the street population (Attachment E).", "Allocation of Resources", "Homelessness is an issue that responds positively to appropriate resource investments. The complexity across LA County and in Santa Monica is that the need for services exceeds available resources. Making new investments requires careful consideration of where the greatest return on investment can be gained. The homeless service system is made up of three parts: (1) outreach, (2) care management and supportive services, and (3) permanent affordable housing, all of which are currently over-subscribed and under-funded relative to demand. The following provides more detailed information on these aspects of the homeless service system:", "Outreach", "Outreach is conducted by non-profit agencies, county departments and collaborative efforts by the police department. The goal of outreach is to connect with people on the street, assess their situation and guide them towards the appropriate homeless service system equipped to meet their needs. In short, individuals are triaged to local services when they have ties to Santa Monica, connected to LA County resources if they hail from other parts of the region or provided resources to reconnect with family in their community of origin.", "Care Management and Supportive Services", "Care management and supportive services is the next element of the service system. Locally, Santa Monica invests over $2.8 million annually through the Human Services Grants Program to provide comprehensive services to address housing and behavioral health needs of homeless households that meet the City\u2019s program eligibility criteria (Attachment F) This is coordinated through the Santa Monica Chronic Homeless Project (CHP). CHP manages the needs of each highly vulnerable individuals and addresses gaps between care providers to ensure high connectivity between programs. Care management services follow individuals as they transition from the streets into permanent housing. CHP services providers address clients\u2019 ongoing needs once they are housed with the goal to enable them to retain housing. The on-going need for supportive services puts a strain on case management capacity over time if additional resources specifically for housing retention are not scaled to match the number of people placed into housing annually.", "Permanent Affordable Housing", "Permanent affordable housing is the third element of the homeless service system and critical to ending homelessness. Outreach and supportive services can only go so far if there is no permanent affordable housing to access. Santa Monica has long prioritized and committed to investing and building permanent affordable housing (including supportive housing). The City has done so in step with delivering intensive services to the most vulnerable individuals to offer complete, permanent solutions to support homeless households. The City is also committed to preventing Santa Monica residents from becoming homeless, with a focus on vulnerable low-income seniors and people with disabilities, especially those in rent controlled housing.", "Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Solutions", "The ongoing challenge facing Santa Monica and the region is the debate over where to put new investments to address homelessness. Investing in outreach and engagement is \u201cquick\u201d and responsive to the day-to-day impacts homelessness has on the community. Care management and supportive services are the harder, more involved and long term work. It is more resource intensive, requires more coordination between providers and municipalities, is not visible to the public, and available to fewer people. However, this intensive work can alleviate barriers at the individual level that prolong homelessness. And finally, it is creating and implementing policies that promote the development of affordable housing and permanent supportive housing that can actually end homelessness for the most vulnerable individuals in our community and in the region.", "As discussed in the May 8, 2017 Information Item (Attachment B), the City must evaluate proposed solutions and support those that address existing local needs, get households to appropriate housing with services, and help households retain housing. The City must weigh the impacts of anchoring new programs locally versus the slower process of advocating and supporting other Westside entities to build momentum and expertise to implement their own long-term permanent solutions to address and prevent homelessness. Increasing regional capacity will reduce the strain on Santa Monica\u2019s homeless service system, reduce the impacts on the Santa Monica community and address the concerns of residents, business operators and visitors.", "Measure H Funding", "On October 1, 2017, LA County began collecting the Measure H sales tax approved by voters in March of this year. A projected $355 million in annual revenue will be collected for services to address homelessness. This new funding will accelerate the implementation of the County's Homeless Initiatives, with a focus on 21 of the 47 adopted strategies including: prevention, subsidized housing, increasing income, case management, coordination across systems and increasing the supply of affordable housing. The City's additional investments in outreach as of October 24, 2017 will rely on these expanded regional Measure H-funded programs to move people through the system of care.", "Discussion", "A fundamental principle throughout the Homeless Strategic Goal Action Plan is proactive engagement, the idea that widespread homelessness is neither inevitable nor acceptable -- and everyone must play an active part in doing whatever it takes to create change.", "To respond to the homelessness crisis, we are prioritizing proactive engagement with homeless individuals throughout our community\u2019s public areas (including parks, beaches, libraries, alleys and streets) and mobilizing a communitywide effort to promote donations to social service agencies; volunteerism; and informed advocacy that can positively address regional and statewide policies that affect homelessness in Santa Monica.", "Proactive engagement of homeless individuals will be increased by the proposed 10-12 new outreach workers; re-deployed and augmented Police Department resources; a software solution that enriches first responders\u2019 contacts with homeless people; and a full time social worker in the Library system.

Therefore, staff is proposing to use a significant portion of one-time funds to create a surge of outreach teams - partnering with the County and local non-profits - using different staffing configurations to pilot different approaches in City parks and libraries. The goal is to create a highly visible increased presence in targeted geographic areas. Teams will proactively engage homeless individuals, triage their needs, and connect them to appropriate resources, with a heavy focus on leveraging county programs.

The team then also stays with the client throughout the housing placement process, eliminating the need to hand-off clients from one team to another, which can disrupt the trust built by outreach teams with the individual. This service delivery strategy is relatively new compared to traditional service models and is less researched than existing approaches.

For residential and commercial structures that are owner-occupied, the net operating income is determined by the income the property would produce if rented. In exchange for a property tax reduction, the owner agrees to protect, maintain and, if necessary, restore the historic property.", "Under the traditional method of determining property taxes, properties are reassessed when sold. However, since Mills Act contracts run with the property, subsequent owners may realize greater tax benefits, as the assessed property value typically increases when the property is sold, resulting in an even greater difference between the property taxes under the assessed valuation method versus the property tax calculation permitted by the Mills Act contract. This can be a significant marketing feature for the property in terms of future sales and is considered an important historic preservation incentive because the property will be maintained.

Those goals included reducing fare handling to speed up transit travel time by encouraging use of prepaid period passes through incentivized pricing, minimizing ridership loss by providing a range of attractively priced options, and increasing revenue to offset Expo service integration operating expenditures.", "Reduction of TAP Stored Value Single Ride Fare on Rechargeable TAP Cards from $1.25 to $1.10", "The 2016 changes to the fare structure were successful in attracting some customers away from cash. The portion of customers who pay with cash declined from 50% at the conclusion of FY2014-15 to 44% at the conclusion of FY2016-17, reducing cash handling and vehicle dwell time. This proposal seeks to further reduce cash transactions from 44% to 15%, replacing them with TAP transactions.", "Cash customers require an average of 23 seconds of dwell time to complete payment, while a prepaid customer using a magnetic stripe card or smartcard requires less than 4 seconds on average to pay for their ride. The benefit of reducing cash transactions from 44% to 15% of all boardings is an expectation of an overall increase in travel speed of approximately .5 mph across the system. This increase in travel speed translates to a reduced operating cost of approximately 55 cents per customer per ride.", "Reduced cash handling and dwell time not only benefit BBB, but also provide a significant benefit to customers. Recent ridership reductions have strengthened the argument for exploring the question as to what can make BBB services more attractive to customers. BBB customer surveys have confirmed that the single largest complaint regarding BBB service is the excessive time it takes to travel by bus. In the open ended question \u201cWhat is the most important thing BBB could do to improve your experience?\u201d, 81% of respondents cited some aspect of travel time as being the most important place for improvement. The significantly longer boarding time of cash customers produces a drag on system efficiency, as all customers must wait for each transaction to complete before the bus can move forward. Increasing the number of customers using prepaid fares through discounting of passes enhances the attractiveness of transit, while simultaneously lowering the cost of operating the routes on a per customer basis.", "When examining strategies for attracting customers away from cash and towards prepaid fare media, BBB customers have expressed an overwhelming preference for paying with stored value on TAP, which is now the prevailing way to pay when customers are choosing between all publicly available fare products. TAP stored value is not only the most commonly chosen way to pay one\u2019s fare, it also continues to attract new riders. Ridership using this method of payment on BBB is up 51% in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016, and is close to one million riders annually.", "Reduction of the single ride fare on TAP stored value is expected to attract two-thirds of remaining cash riders, many of whom currently have access to TAP stored value but do not use it on BBB as there is no economic advantage to doing so.", "The net immediate impact of this change will be a short-term annual reduction in fare revenue as customers pay less fare using TAP stored value. However, it is a reasonable assumption that the new lower fare of $1.10 will attract new customers that do not currently ride BBB.", "Adding an Annual Unlimited Ride Pass and Standardized Pricing for Employers Providing Group Purchase of Fares for Employees (Blue to Business)", "Big Blue Bus staff has conducted a thorough review of its pricing structure and recommends introduction of an annual unlimited ride pass sold individually, as well as Blue to Business, a pricing structure for employers who wish to supply annual passes to employees, both those who use transit regularly and those who use transit infrequently, to encourage more use. The need for transit pass alternatives was identified through discussions with the Transportation Demand Management staff of the City of Santa Monica, who noted that the monthly pass distribution or monthly TAP reload process is cumbersome for employer subsidy programs and long-term transit users. The tedious process invites discontinuance of transit use by re-engaging consumers on a monthly basis about their transit choice. Annual unlimited ride passes address these concerns by facilitating easy provision of employer transportation benefits, removing the monthly workload of pass distribution or TAP re-loading, and avoiding the month-to-month decision making of employers and employees as to whether they should continue with the benefit.", "The price of $500 for annual passes sold individually (ten times $50 monthly price) instead of $600 (twelve times $50 monthly price) takes into account two important considerations. Many employers, including the City of Santa Monica, exercise restraint in buying transit passes and elect not to buy a monthly pass for an employee who takes vacation or is otherwise absent in any given month, and instead purchase other fare products. As such, many employers do not buy twelve monthly passes for their employees. The second consideration is that employers have an expectation that committing to an annual pass will bring them some cost benefit over what they are currently spending to support an employee with transit subsidy for a full year.", "The standardized Blue to Business pricing for employers making group purchases of passes for employees is designed for employers who wish to encourage more transit use amongst employees who may only infrequently use transit or not use it at all. Typically, if an employer provides transit passes to only those employees who use transit, it is to less than 15% of employees. The Blue to Business pricing discounts bus passes based on the percent of employees supplied a pass, beginning at 15% of all employees. Price incentives are also available for 30%, 50%, 75% and 100% of all employees supplied transit passes. This pricing enables employers to provide unlimited use transit access to more employees at low cost, on the assumption that as one provides more passes, transit use per pass diminishes.", "This pricing structure uses known ridership patterns at other employers to determine appropriate price points for each percentage level (see Blue to Business Attachment E for detail). Employers will be required to commit to 12 months of purchase in order to qualify for Blue to Business pricing and will be provided a 12-month pass for each employee. Employers will be able to adjust percentages of employees supplied passes at their annual renewal date.", "The Blue to Business program aims to provide flexibility that serves not only employers but also Big Blue Bus. The intention behind the pricing is that Big Blue Bus obtain the same revenue per ride as cash fare (currently $1.25) for each ride provided. At the end of each calendar year, the prices charged at each percentage point will be adjusted for the new year based on ridership activity in the prior year. Pricing will be raised or lowered in order to keep revenue per ride in alignment with the current base fare. Pricing for individual employers will be adjusted as each employer contract renews.", "Charging a Fare to Personal Care Assistants Travelling with ACCESS Services Clients", "Through a contract with ACCESS services, people certified as ACCESS services eligible currently ride BBB without paying a fare by tapping their ACCESS Services ID card on the TAP light validator. BBB then records these rides and bills ACCESS Services a 50 cent discounted fare for each ride.", "Some ACCESS services clients travel with Personal Care Assistants, who under current BBB policy do not pay a fare. Those riders do not carry an ACCESS services TAP card, are not certified through ACCESS, and do not board with any fare product under BBB policy. The rides taken by Personal Care Assistants are not reimbursed by ACCESS.", "Staff initially proposed charging the regular adult fare to ACCESS Personal Care Assistants because the current policy is problematic in that it sets up an inequity between Personal Care Assistants and all other people who are expected to either pay their fare, or are supported by another organization that pays their fare on their behalf, such as ACCESS Services, Santa Monica College, or the rider\u2019s employer. The current policy also sets up an inequity between PCAs who do not pay a fare when riding with ACCESS certified disabled customers and PCAs who are charged a regular fare while riding with non-ACCESS certified disabled customers. Requiring all Personal Care Assistants to pay a fare regardless of what fare type the disabled customer travels with would eliminate this inequity.", "Title VI Civil Rights Considerations", "The revision of the price of a TAP stored value ride from $1.25 to $1.10 is subject to a fare equity analysis as defined by BBB\u2019s Major Service and Fare Change Policy. The fare equity analysis is required to ensure compliance with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI regulations as defined by FTA Circular 4702.1B. The purpose of the analysis is to determine whether the proposed changes will result in a disparate impact on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin, or a disproportionate burden on the low-income population.", "Based on the thresholds set in the stated policy, minority customers would not experience a disparate impact as a result of the revised fare structure, nor would low-income customers experience a disproportionate burden as a result of the revised fare structure.", "Communication Plan", "Communication regarding the proposed new fares and fare media began on June 30, 2017.

There was a quorum of Commissioners present, Commission staff, and one BBB staff member who presented on the fare adjustment proposal focusing on the recommendation to implement the regular fare of $1.25 for Personal Care Attendants.", "BBB staff presented that the current policy of allowing PCAs to ride without paying a fare on fixed route is not mirrored at other surrounding transit agencies, that the policy creates opportunities for abuse, and that it creates an inequity as this benefit does not exist for PCAs traveling with Dial-a-Ride customers or customers riding through Senior/Disabled/Medicare fares on BBB. Commissioners heard the presentation, but expressed concern regarding charging PCAs. Understanding the Commissioners\u2019 concerns, staff will revisit this recommendation in conjunction with a total fare analysis of fixed route and Dial-a-Ride fares in preparation for the next exceptions-based budget.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "In the former transit marketplace, forces such as changes in fare were well understood and could be easily interpreted to cause predictable outcomes. However, with the recent national downturn in bus ridership, and the new entries into the transportation marketplace such as transportation network companies (TNCs), these causal relationships are now harder to predict.", "Staff can predict with some certainty that reducing fares would reduce short term revenue by approximately $697,000. However, providing accurate predictions of increased ridership and the associated revenue due to reduced fares is more of a challenge given recent trends.", "Given elasticities of demand that have long held true in public transit, the changes to the base fare on TAP and the $500 annual pass would be expected to generate an additional 216,000 riders generating $239,000 additional revenue for Big Blue Bus, offsetting the short term losses. The introduction of Blue to Business fares would be expected to generate another 102,000 annual rides in the first year and $127,500 in new fares associated with those rides. The effect of these changes would be a net loss of $330,500 annually in fare revenue and an increase of approximately 318,000 riders in the same year.", "Big Blue Bus will monitor the effects of these changes and report back to Council 12 months after implementation to report on the full financial impacts.

Canary Island date palms are susceptible to vascular wilt disease (Fusarium oxysporum) that unfortunately is untreatable and leads to the eventual death of infected plants. Some of the Palisades Park palms in this arboricultural feature have been exposed to this fungal disease. As a result, an estimated 25% of the date palms in the colonnade have succumbed to the disease and been removed during the last 10 years. Replacing the palms is necessary for the preservation of historic integrity of Palisades Park. To increase the resilience of the park\u2019s palm tree population, staff proposes introducing three new palm species that are resistant to the fungal disease.

A key landscape feature of the park is the colonnades of palm trees orientated north to south. This feature is primarily composed of two palm species: Mexican fan palm (Washingtonia robusta) and Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis). There are approximately 370 Mexican fan palms and 226 Canary Island date palms throughout Palisades Park. The majority of the Canary Island date palms are found in a colonnade row feature that runs the entire length of the park from south to north.", "In recent years, the colonnade feature consisting of nearly 200 Canary Island date palms has become eroded by the fungal disease Fusarium oxysporum, which often spreads through pruning. This disease is currently untreatable and nearly always fatal once a plant is infected. On August 14, 2007, staff presented an Information Item to the City Council, which detailed the impact of this disease to Canary Island date palms in Palisades Park (Attachment A). It is estimated that nearly 25% of the Canary Island date palms in the colonnade have died and been removed because of this disease. Improved pruning practices has greatly slowed the spread of the disease within the City\u2019s population of Canary Island date palms.", "Discussion", "Over the last 12 months, staff have evaluated the palm colonnade feature in Palisades Park for potential planting locations and to assess the condition of existing palms. This evaluation has led to the formulation of a planting plan for the colonnade, which defines approximately 56 planting locations and three new palm species (Attachment C). The planting plan uses one of the species designated for the east side of Ocean Avenue in the Urban Forest Master Plan. This will help create a uniform and architecturally attractive streetscape.", "To mitigate the loss of the Canary Island date palms in the colonnade, B & B Nurseries, Inc. would plant up to 56 new palms.

Further, average \u201ctotal lost days\u201d per injured MCO who underwent functional evaluation testing was 2.4 days; this compares to 76 days for all MCOs.

In April 2017, staff conducted a competitive bidding process to assess the ITSM market to confirm whether upgrading the existing system would yield the best return on investment, as compared to purchasing an out-of-the-box, more feature-rich solution to better meet the City\u2019s needs. As a result of the competitive process, staff identified ServiceNow as the solution that best aligns with City requirements. At this time, staff recommends executing a contract with Carahsoft Technology Corporation for licensing, training, and implementation services of ServiceNow. The initial costs for implementation, including year one licensing, training and $88,000 contingency, would be $531,000. The ongoing licensing costs for year two through five would be $486,000.

Nominal scheduled maintenance of the artificial turf including monthly vacuuming and grooming would be required. Artificial turf would be least susceptible to premature deterioration due to the elements. The drainage improvements for collecting storm water and to control excess surface runoff contribute to the higher project cost. A downside to this option is the considerable number of truck trips generated by the amount of exported material generated and required imported fill.

If that requirement could not be met onsite, the excess water demand would have to be offset by reducing the water demand (through fixture replacement) at other sites within the City. Given this water neutrality requirement, much if not all of the projected overall increase in future sewage flow should be offset through this growth-funded plumbing fixture retrofit program.", "It should be noted that while this water neutrality program may offset an increase in overall sewage flows, Water Neutrality may still allow for an increase in flows at any specific site. With this program provision, some of the large future developments could still have a substantial point load increase in sewage discharges.

In utilizing the model to simulate future conditions, the City\u2019s sewer system continues to perform well. In fact, under future conditions, only 3% of the modeled pipelines exceeded the evaluation depth of flow criteria (depth of flow greater than half of the pipe diameter). Although 1% existing and 3% future capacity shortfall results represent a favorable outcome of this analysis, any Sanitary Sewer Overflow which occurs can become an environmental hazard to the coastal environment. By addressing problem areas proactively, spills may be prevented and hazards avoided.", "The condition of the existing system and its ability to address future conditions with relatively modest investment lead to a proposed 5-year Capital Improvement Program.

Los Angeles County is experiencing a mounting crisis with this year\u2019s annual Homeless Count showing a 23% increase countywide and a 26% increase in Santa Monica (after five years of no increases following a significant decline).", "Santa Monica will not accept that homelessness is inevitable. While the regional homeless crisis can\u2019t be \u201csolved\u201d within our borders, our City is determined to invest additional local resources, stand with neighboring communities and take a leadership role in regional solutions. We will gather and share timely data to track and analyze both overall progress and individual cases and share the models that prove effective; we will relentlessly and compassionately engage people experiencing homelessness in order to make appropriate referrals to local and regional programs; we will mobilize a community-wide effort to augment and target public, non-profit, civic and business resources; we will work with LA County, LA City and other regional partners to continually innovate, pursuing effective and compassionate approaches wherever they can be found. City staff believe this comprehensive approach can make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people and support health, safety and equity in our local community.", "Such a comprehensive and sustained community-wide approach will require a significant increase in the level of resources devoted to staff training, outreach efforts, social services, housing placement and retention, law enforcement, public information and education, data collection, analysis, and sharing. Naming a Senior Advisor for Homelessness to focus exclusively on the issue out of the City Manager\u2019s Office would locate policy, program, and resource development in the executive office, create new capacity for intergovernmental and community relations to better leverage and coordinate our partnerships with regional agencies, Los Angeles County and nearby cities, as well as enlist residents, businesses, civic organizations, houses of worship and local non-profits in collaborative action.", "Background", "Over the course of 40 years, Santa Monica\u2019s local investment in permanent solutions to address homelessness has produced a sophisticated, collaborative approach effective in transitioning highly vulnerable individuals off the streets and into housing. The City\u2019s homeless policies, like its service system, have evolved over many years to be a reflection of the priorities and needs of this community. Homelessness, however, is not an isolated local concern. Santa Monica is but one of 88 cities in LA County, which is home to the second largest homeless population in the country. Over 57,000 homeless individuals were identified through the 2017 LA County Homeless Count. Unlike other urban centers where the majority of homeless people are in shelters, 74% of LA County\u2019s population is literally on the streets and in public spaces. The scale of the regional homeless crisis has pushed Santa Monica\u2019s local homeless system beyond its capacity to meet growing demand.", "The plight of homelessness has taken on a higher profile and priority nationwide in the past year as local and state governments are becoming increasingly overwhelmed by the depth and breadth of this growing problem. The County of Los Angeles has adopted a set of 47 strategies (Attachment A) that encompass services, shelters, employment, benefits, outreach, jail diversion and system coordination and a funding plan for three years of projected Measure H revenue. The City of Los Angeles has begun awarding funding generated through Proposition HHH, a $1.2 billion bond measure passed in November 2016 to fund supportive and other types of housing for homeless people. Locally, Santa Monica residents voted to enact Measure GSH, a local transaction and use tax, a portion of which willfund affordable housing.", "On August 23, 2015, City Council established taking a leadership role in regional efforts to address homelessness as one of the City\u2019s top five strategic priorities (Attachment B). The Council instructed staff to do more on a regional level, especially by engaging with LA City and County partners to address these local impacts, and to continue to innovate and invest locally. The Community and Cultural Services Department (CCS) convenes the Chronic Homeless Project (CHP) which brings local and county services together to share resources and collaborate on case plans for homeless individuals. In addition, the Santa Monica Police Department\u2019s Homeless Liaison Program (HLP) team hosts an interdepartmental meeting to track progress and coordinate efforts to house chronic offenders. CCS also leads the Senior Housing Task Force, which brings together city departments and non-profit providers to identify and support low-income seniors at risk of homelessness, and partners with the City Attorney\u2019s Office to administer the Homeless Community Court. The Housing and Economic Development Department is dedicated to preserving existing affordable housing in Santa Monica and creating new housing opportunities for residents with low and moderate incomes. The Housing Division administers federal Continuum of Care vouchers, Section 8 housing vouchers, and Housing Trust funds for this purpose.", "In June 2017, CCS and the City Manager initiated a community homelessness steering committee comprised of representatives from the business community, City commissions, faith partners, non-profit agencies, LA County services as well as state and county elected offices. Local organizations such as the Westside Coalition, Downtown Santa Monica, Inc., Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce and Santa Monica Travel and Tourism frequently invite CCS staff to provide updates on local and regional homeless issues. Regionally, the City participates in a range of planning meetings hosted by LA County\u2019s Chief Executive Office, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority and the United Way of Greater LA, and represents the Westside Cities Council of Governments on the Regional Homeless Advisory Council. The City also meets regularly with other Westside jurisdictions and state and county elected offices to coordinate regional efforts and leverage local resources.", "The City is also pursuing a range of responses to safety in public spaces \u2013 funding Ambassadors into Tongva and Palisades Park, heavily programming Reed Park with activities and focusing law enforcement on Chess Park. All have had some success, but all require a level of resources that are currently difficult to scale and sustain citywide.", "Discussion", "An increase in homelessness between 2016 and 2017 locally (26%) and regionally (23%) have strained the City\u2019s existing strategies and resources. The County of Los Angeles is at an inflection point \u2013 the decisions made today both locally and regionally on policy and implementation of new programs will decide if the curve of homelessness continues to climb or whether strategic investments and collaborative efforts can turn the tide. Many cities are declaring a state of emergency to signal the importance of addressing this issue. Santa Monica has taken a more pragmatic approach, redeploying resources to service the homeless, engaging the business and resident communities, and serving as a regional partner with neighboring cities and the County.", "In response to Council naming homelessness as a strategic goal, staff formed an interdepartmental Homeless Strategic Goal team. This group worked across department lines to develop an action plan with seven desired outcomes (below) and associated goals and metrics which relate to the City\u2019s outcomes regarding place and planet, economic opportunity, and community.", "1.

Prevent homelessness among low-income SM residents", "As the surge in homeless individuals on our streets, in our parks and in our libraries is visible and disturbing, staff is testing new interventions in public spaces. A team of Human Services Division staff and two police officers recently engaged people experiencing homelessness at two parks in Santa Monica. They relied on Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data during the interaction to connect homeless individuals to resources that correspond to their needs and tested the usefulness of using such data in the field. Regular and pop-up social services connections are happening at the Main Library, a model of bringing services to people where they already are.", "As the team continues to implement its Action Plan, strategies will evolve and emerge, focusing on the most effective ways to address homelessness in Santa Monica. The City\u2019s Action Plan is embedded in a larger strategic framework for dealing with the local impacts of the regional homelessness crisis. The four elements of this effort (which goes well beyond the scope and resources of City government) include:", "1) To address the increase in homeless individuals in our community, we will relentlessly, humanely, compassionately, constitutionally and effectively engage people in distress. This effort will encompass not only our front-line emergency response staff in Police and Fire. We will also provide scalable training and information that can be used by other City staff, non-profit service providers, Downtown Santa Monica Ambassadors and volunteer community members and businesspeople, as appropriate.", "2) To maximize the City\u2019s resources, we will coordinate planning, communication and collaborative action across numerous city departments, community-based organizations, the business community and regional partners, working with a new Homeless Steering Committee that is being organized by these stakeholders.", "3) To leverage available data, we will share useful information to provide appropriate assistance and to make allocation of resources and evaluation of interventions more accurate, timely and effective.", "4) Recognizing the regional nature of this challenge, we will actively work in support of the evolution and funding of the regional homeless services system that provides critical outreach, mental health, housing, health care and other services to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people and support health, safety and equity in our local community.", "In addition, the City will deal firmly and effectively with criminal and anti-social behavior that is often mistakenly conflated with the problem of homelessness. Homeless people are more likely to be the victims of crime than perpetrators. There also exists, however, an increasingly estranged and alienated element of transient individuals whose drug and alcohol use, as well as criminal and/or chronic anti-social behaviors have made them menaces to public safety. This is a particularly difficult challenge to which law enforcement alone is an insufficient answer. We will work creatively and consistently to ensure the safety and enjoyment of Santa Monica\u2019s public spaces are not threatened by this small, but deeply troubled segment of our population. We will continue to treat people as individuals, not stigmatize all homeless people with the behaviors of a small fraction who constitute a threat to others.", "A Senior Advisor for Homelessness would focus exclusively on the overall approach to the homelessness issue out of the City Manager\u2019s Office, further develop the four-pronged strategy and its implementation plans and long-term funding strategies, represent the City\u2019s interests to intergovernmental and other partners, and engage the community on this issue. This approach is not new. In 2005 and 2006, Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman served the City in a somewhat similar role, advancing the City\u2019s policies and priorities regarding regional collaboration and fair share allocation of resources. In addition, for many years City Manager\u2019s Office senior staff members devoted significant time to local, state, and federal intergovernmental relations. Staffing patterns in the Manager\u2019s Office have changed and capacity for this work has diminished, increasing the need for this position, which would bear primary responsibility for homelessness-related intergovernmental and community relations.", "Given the increasing gravity of the regional homelessness crisis and its local impact, having a Senior Advisor for Homelessness as a member of the City Manager\u2019s Office could further our progress profoundly and meaningfully. Establishing such a position would locate policy, program, and funding development in the executive office, increase intergovernmental and community relations capacity, and provide community and regional stakeholders with a single point of contact with direct access to the City Manager and Council. Departments would continue to offer, evaluate, and improve the numerous services dedicated to addressing homelessness and implement the strategic goal team\u2019s action plan.", "Therefore, the City Manager requests the addition of one Senior Advisor on Homeless to be added to the City Manager\u2019s Office for a two-year limited term basis, through June 2019. This position would be funded by the General Fund with an impact of $135,875 ($181,166 prorated to nine months for FY 2017-18) and $184,284 for FY 2018-19.", "Fiscal Impacts and Budget Actions", "The addition of a Senior Advisor for Homelessness requires a net increase of 1.0 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) positions in the City Manager\u2019s Office during the remainder of FY 2017-18.

The client completed a residential alcohol treatment program, was linked to a sober living program at CLARE Foundation, employment training at Chrysalis, and a permanent housing voucher through the regional Coordinated Entry System. This individual is now working a full-time job in Santa Monica, and is regularly engaged in activities to promote his sobriety, mental and physical health, and permanent housing. In the year prior to engaging with HMST, this individual was arrested by SMPD four times and transported by SMFD to local hospitals twice.

Consistent multi-year assessments are necessary to demonstrate the effects of social service interventions, the impacts of which are best measured by changes over time as illustrated by other evaluative tools such as The Wellbeing Index and the Youth Wellbeing Report Card.  RAND Corporation has approach the City with an offer to review the data collected by HMST, first responders and local hospitals, looking specifically at the effectiveness of the intervention for this highly vulnerable population and to see if the service model results in fewer contacts with local emergency services. RAND is offering this at no cost to the City. Staff recommends that the City enter into a professional services agreement with RAND for this work.", "Should the evaluation of HMST confirm that this level of intervention is effective not only in placing vulnerable clients in housing but also reducing the impact on local emergency resources, the Community and Cultural Services Department may request an enhancement of the Human Services Grants Program (HSGP) budget to provide ongoing, sustainable funding for this program.

Representatives from the University of Southern California (USC)\u2019s Keck School of Medicine and the Milken Institute approached the City in March 2017 offering to develop a custom data sharing platform for first responders based on a similar health care data sharing system developed by Akido Labs, a software company built out of Keck Medicine. Around the same time, staff evaluated a similar product, GetRideALong.org, which was developed by a Code for America team for the Seattle Police Department\u2019s Crisis Response Team and gives officers key information about people with mental illness at the scene. RideaLong submitted a proposal for development of a custom software solution. Staff determined that RideALong\u2019s solution would have cost significantly more money and taken a much longer time to develop than the solution proposed by Akido.", "Akido has proposed a three-phased approach to supporting data sharing and the coordination of care for homeless individuals who are frequently contacted by first responders. The first and second phases, which include discovery, development of data governance policies, and development, implementation, testing, and licensure of a pilot solution, would not result in a cost to the City. This work is expected to take approximately six months. The third phase of scaling, configuring, and implementing the software for multiple year use would take approximately four months. A one-time user-training fee of $5,000 would be charged at the end of FY17-18. Annual licensing and support would likely begin in early FY18-19 and would be charged based in part on needed support services. Service levels may vary over time as the solution is implemented. A service level agreement exhibit would be included in the contract. Additional services such as data analysis, design, development, and integration would be priced at $150/hour. Staff recommends entering into a four-year agreement with Akido not to exceed $85,000, with an option to extend the agreement by three additional years, as an exception to the competitive bidding process pursuant to Section 2.24.080 (d) given the proprietary nature of the product and its specify to Santa Monica.

For FY 2017-18, staff estimates the Airport will produce $12.2M in rental revenue by eliminating master tenants Gunnell Properties, American Flyers, Krueger Aviation, partial elimination of Atlantic Aviation as a master tenant, and raising rents to reflect market rates.", "Continued Phasing Out of Master Tenants is Likely to Result in Increases in Leasing Revenues", "There are three leftover master tenants subleasing a mix of facilities at Santa Monica Airport. A master tenant is considered a landlord of subtenants, meaning that a master tenant is able to evict a subtenant, collect rent, set terms, etc. The three master tenants at Santa Monica Airport combined have approximately 147 subtenants.

Of the three remaining master tenants only Atlantic Aviation is an aviation master tenant. Staff intends to phase out the remaining master tenants during FY 2017-18. An orderly transition provides the City the time needed to build the management capacity required to assume the added responsibilities.", "Staff believes leasing revenues at the Airport will increase, albeit at a much slower pace than over the last two years, during FY 17-18 due to several on-going lease negotiations. For instance, assuming Atlantic Aviation and the City agree to terms on a three-year lease for its facility per the Consent Decree, staff anticipates the City will realize greater revenue from the premises occupied by Atlantic Aviation for two reasons. First, Atlantic Aviation\u2019s rent is likely to be adjusted upward to reflect market rates and second the City will be transitioning Atlantic\u2019s sub-tenants into direct tenants of the City. In addition to lease negotiations with Atlantic Aviation, the City is or soon will be in lease negotiations with Santa Monica College and Santa Monica Air Center. Santa Monica Art Studios will also be renegotiated and the new terms may lead to an increase in future revenues.", "Operating and Capital Expenditures Are Projected to Increase", "As forecast in March 2016, staff report, having the City take over as a direct landlord has increased real estate brokerage fees, property management fees, and capital expenditures. In response to the increase in property management responsibilities and real estate brokerage duties, the City hired Aeroplex Property Management and Commercial Management Group following the competitive bidding process. In FY 2017-18, staff has budgeted $500,000 to cover property management fees and real estate brokerage fees.", "Expenditures for capital improvements, repairs, maintenance and replacement now, and will into the foreseeable future, consume significant capital due to the poor condition of the facilities formerly managed by the above master tenants. In order to determine the magnitude of the problem, staff intends to perform a comprehensive facilities condition assessment (FCA) in FY 17-18. The runway shortening project will also require significant funding. With proper management, vigilant oversight, and prudent fiscal restraint, staff is confident the Airport will be able to maintain aviation facilities up to standard, repay its debt, and maintain a safe airport, until it closes in 2028.", "Alternatives", "Staff identifies three possible alternatives:", "1.

The current entitlements would allow for an additional 15,000 sq. ft. bringing the total usable floor area to approximately 45,000 sq. ft. at build out. In order to design usable office space in the basement level, significant modifications would need to be made to allow access to natural light, which would likely further limit the available floor area of the building.

There are significant restrictions on modifications made to buildings with landmark status that would generate significant challenges. Even under the best of circumstances, the separated lobby and the basement condition at the Post Office Building would make it difficult to create conditions that would accommodate all of the relocated City staff. The existing permitted plans allow for just 54 occupants. In order to increase that number to allow for even 100 occupants the entire space would need to be redesigned and new permits would need to be obtained, which would add to the cost of the project.

To summarize, not all City staff currently in leased office space could be adequately housed in the Post Office Building, requiring the City to continue leasing space for some functions. It would not centralize currently disparate City functions in one location because some of those functions would have to remain at City Hall and others in leased space. The small amount of parking on the site after build out would require City staff to park in other locations in the downtown, impacting the parking supply in the area. This represents an expensive option that would maintain the current status quo with regard to location of City staff and inefficient service delivery to the public.

BBB represents a little over one-quarter of the City\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation open claim inventory and generates roughly 90 to 100 new claims per year. Further, it receives claims from a cross-section of workers that mirrors the City\u2019s total inventory of claims (i.e., claims from workers performing sedentary jobs and physically demanding jobs). These characteristics, coupled with the BBB\u2019s keen desire to be more involved in managing its workers\u2019 compensation claims, make it the ideal test group in the City for the pilot program.", "Once BBB was selected for the pilot, a group of staff from BBB, Finance/Risk Management, and Human Resources was assembled to develop and issue an RFP for claims administration services.  The group also established the following parameters for pursuing the pilot program:", "\u00b7 Implementation: The TPA will manage all of BBB\u2019s existing workers\u2019 compensation claims and any new claims received during the pilot period. BBB staff, in turn, will serve as the TPA\u2019s primary contact throughout the pilot program. BBB already handles certain human resources-oriented tasks with internal staff, and as such, is uniquely positioned to effectively oversee the efforts of a TPA.", "The balance of the City\u2019s claims will continue to be managed by the City\u2019s in-house staff in Risk Management. Efforts of the in-house staff previously devoted to BBB will be redeployed to the remaining claim inventory. This will bring down internal staff caseloads to approximately 110 claims per examiner, which is equivalent to the TPA examiner caseload requirements set out in the RFP and considered an industry best practice.", "\u00b7 Ongoing Oversight: BBB, Finance/Risk Management, and Human Resources will work together to closely monitor the TPA\u2019s performance during the pilot period to ensure that any issues with TPA performance are detected and addressed in a timely manner.", "\u00b7 Employee Notification: Injured employees with open workers\u2019 compensation claims will be provided ample notice of the changeover so all questions/concerns can be addressed and all medical services and benefit payments continue without interruption.", "\u00b7 Accounting Arrangements: The BBB\u2019s share of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Self-Insurance Fund\u2019s (Fund 59) assets and liabilities will be calculated and transferred to a newly created fund so that pilot program financial performance can be accurately tracked. Once these figures are available, staff will return to Council for authorization to create a Transit Workers\u2019 Compensation Self-Insurance Fund and transfer the assets/liabilities.", "\u00b7 Program Evaluation: BBB and Finance/Risk Management will evaluate the pilot program\u2019s success against a set of objective performance measures  (e.g., total cost per claim, lost-time per claim, total open claim inventory, overhead costs per claim, etc.) and subjective performance measures (e.g., employee satisfaction surveys, employee focus groups, etc.) throughout the pilot period and at its conclusion. BBB and Risk Management will be responsible for reporting out at regular intervals to the Working Group on the pilot program\u2019s performance. At the conclusion of the three-year pilot period, the Working Group will make a recommendation to the City Council as to whether the TPA contract should be terminated, extended for BBB only (thus the inclusion of the two, one-year renewal options), or possibly expanded to include a larger segment of the City\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims.", "TPA Selection Results", "On March 7, 2017, the City published an RFP for workers\u2019 compensation claims administration services for the BBB.

The following seven firms submitted a response: AdminSure Inc.; Athens Administrators; Broadspire Services Inc.; CorVel Corporation; Intercare Holdings Insurance Services, Inc.; Tristar Risk Management; and York Risk Management Services.", "An evaluation panel comprised of staff from BBB, Finance/Risk Management, and Human Resources evaluated all seven RFP responses based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.073, including price, staffing commitment, understanding of program goals and objectives, references/experience, incentive plan commitment, and value-added services. The panel used the criteria to narrow the field to four firms who were invited to make on-site presentations. The interviews confirmed all four of the firms were capable of competently fulfilling the RFP\u2019s scope of work and offered competitive pricing and value-added services. On balance, however, Intercare Holdings Insurance Services offered the best combination of staffing, transit claim experience, references, and price.  Therefore, staff recommends Intercare Holdings Insurance Services as the best-qualified firm to provide the claims administration services requested in the RFP.", "Contracted Services Policy", "While the City\u2019s Contracted Services Policy contemplates physical or manual work as opposed to professional services, the intent of the policy, coupled with its evaluation criteria, provided staff with guidance for assessing the appropriateness of pursuing the pilot program. Specifically, the proposal contained in this staff report meets the \u201cspirit\u201d of at least five of the criteria set out in the policy: 1) it is a pilot program; 2) the City would benefit cost-wise from the contractor\u2019s economies of scale; 3) the contractor is better positioned to respond to workload fluctuations; 4) the contractor is equipped with back-up staffing options; and 5) the contractor\u2019s performance can be measured through objective means.

Staff is requesting to amend TCS\u2019s agreement to include assistance with developing the pilot program\u2019s performance measures, transitioning claims administration services to the TPA, and monitoring pilot program performance. This assistance will ensure the TPA transition goes smoothly for staff and injured workers, and BBB and Risk Management are able to closely and accurately monitor the pilot program\u2019s performance. The contract amendment will cost $113,800.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "The agreement to be awarded to Intercare Holdings Insurance Services, Inc. is for an amount not to exceed $1,699,509 over a five-year period.  FY 2017-18 contract costs total $327,900. Further, the agreement modification to be awarded to TCS Risk Management Services, LLC is $113,800 for an amended agreement total not to exceed $326,300. This will increase the FY 2017-18 contract costs by an additional $41,067.

This item is being brought forth now so that the City can participate in the SCE Charge Ready pilot program to receive free electrical infrastructure for EV charging.", "Discussion", "SCE Charge Ready Program", "Deploying public infrastructure for EV charging can be a complicated and expensive process. Existing electrical and site infrastructure in public locations throughout the city are often inadequate to support additional electrical demand from EV charging. Design, engineering and construction that includes electrical infrastructure upgrades necessary to facilitate the installation of EV chargers typically cost two to five times the cost of the charger itself, which often makes the installation of EV chargers impractical.", "To help alleviate this issue, Southern California Edison (SCE) developed a pilot program called Charge Ready. Charge Ready offers site hosts the opportunity to receive free electrical infrastructure \u2013 including design, permitting and construction \u2013 to support a minimum of 10 charging spaces per installation location and a rebate for the purchase cost of the EV chargers.

This would reduce the rate of charge by a nominal amount; however, if aggregated across a number of chargers, the reduction in electrical demand can be significant. As a best management practice, fleet vehicles will be directed to charge mostly in the afternoon or evening, when the cost and demand for electricity is low.", "In November 2016, staff applied to receive support through SCE\u2019s Charge Ready application portal and identified two sites for City fleet charging and public charging for a total of 55 charging ports, as detailed below in Table 1.

The Commission report notes that a significant portion of public comment (about possible revisions to the existing Guidelines) involves a recent housing trust fund loan for affordable housing targeted to persons living with disabilities. Concerned that the City should tread cautiously to avoid creating impediments to fair housing (e.g., like imposing a requirement on the developer to conduct a public meeting after a loan commitment has been issued) while simultaneously establishing policies for robust public input regarding affordable housing spending priorities, the Commission recommends, \u201cthat City Council direct the City Attorney to \u2018review existing guidelines and procedures and provide legal advice regarding whether any changes are appropriate.\u2019\u201d Accordingly, the City Attorney\u2019s Office will review the Guidelines for fair housing compliance and staff will return to Council with amendments, if warranted.", "Maximum Loan and Developer Fee Limits", "The maximum housing trust fund loan (and grant) limits pursuant to the current Guidelines are established on a per-unit basis and adjusted annually based upon a Council-approved methodology linked to changes in land and construction costs (see Municipal Code Section 9.64.070{b}). The FY2017-18 limits are illustrated in the table below:", "Maximum Loan/Grant Amount", "Fiscal Year 2017-18", "New Construction", "Acquisition & Rehabilitation", "Zero and 1-Bedroom Units", "$492,848", "$613,710", "2 or more Bedroom Units", "$518,363", "$645,940", "Loans in excess of the maximum (per-unit) amounts must be approved by the City Council, as well as loans involving more than 50 residences. The Housing Commission noted that the combination of the two limits (a per-unit loan limit and a 50-unit loan limit) results in substantial administrative authority for loan approval. In that context, the Commission recommends revising the Guidelines to include an aggregate loan/grant limit of $15 million per affordable housing development. Any loan/grant exceeding $15 million would require City Council approval.", "The proposed $15 million aggregate loan limit raises a few issues. One issue involves a potential disconnect between proprietary and regulatory policies intended to facilitate affordable housing. Since 2005, the Guidelines have included the 50-residence loan limit for affordable housing funding. Similarly, the zoning code provides for administrative approval of affordable housing developments containing 50 residences or fewer. (On July 11, 2017, City Council endorsed a final draft Downtown Community Plan which would allow administrative approval for affordable housing developments.) Revising the current Guidelines to add a $15 million loan limit could result in misalignment of streamlining measures for affordable housing development. For example, a proposed affordable housing development involving 45 residences with an average loan subsidy of $350,000 per residence would require Council approval (45 x $350,000 = $15,750,000), though the housing would not require discretionary approvals.  An additional challenge is that competing for other financing to leverage City funds (such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits) cannot occur until all discretionary approvals are obtained, which can create delays in proposed housing, given application periods are limited to once or twice year. With respect to preservation of existing housing through acquisition and rehabilitation, the proposed $15 million loan limit could limit such opportunities to properties with less than 28 residences, given that recent City loans have averaged $550,000 per residence ($550,000 x 28 = $15,400,000), as sellers may be reluctant to accept purchase offers subject to Council approval.", "Finally, the Housing Commission\u2019s report notes that public comment received involved the issue of increasing the developer fee limit. The \u2018base limit\u2019 amount allowed for the developer fee was last established for the fiscal 2007-08 period, although the amount is adjusted annually per the Guidelines. The Commission did not have adequate opportunity to study and evaluate the issue of developer fee limits, but intends to consider the matter in the future and make a recommendation to Council.", "Next Steps", "An additional issue staff would like to address which was not part of the Housing Commission report involves updating the sustainability goals in affordable housing which would be eligible for financing by housing trust funds (see Exhibit D of the Guidelines, \u201cGreen Affordable Housing Checklist\u201d). Staff will collaborate with the City\u2019s Office of Sustainability and the Environment to prepare recommended updates to Exhibit D, seeking a balance between integrating effective (and required) sustainability features, recognizing the cost-effectiveness thresholds of other public funding programs, and requiring leveraging from federal/state/local sustainability programs where available.

Cora Constructors would supply Toray TMG20D-440 membranes, the same make/model as those currently installed at the Arcadia Water Plant.", "For Part II, installation of new membranes and haul-away and disposal of old membranes, Process Engineering Services provided the lowest overall bid at $38,247, but included a memo of uncertain field conditions related to cleaning the membrane housings which may incur additional cost at the discretion of the City. Due to the six-year timeframe since the last membrane replacement, the amount of scale and build-up cannot be determined without actually opening each housing. Each housing accommodates six 40\u201d x 8\u201d membrane elements and must be cleaned after removal of existing membrane elements and prior to installation of the new elements.

From its infancy as a crossroads of commerce and civic life, to its present day role as bustling local hangout and job/tourist center Downtown\u2019s buildings stand as a record of human endeavor, and as a reflection of the zoning standards that each subsequent generation implemented to guide the urban form priorities of the day. This incremental approach is responsible for the great diversity of building heights Downtown, which range from one-story brick and mortar structures to taller twenty-one-story glass and steel buildings.", "The DCP acknowledges the interplay between the old and new as a necessary ingredient to Downtown\u2019s authenticity, and presents an urban design strategy to safeguard the identifiable historic core within the Bayside Conservation District, and transfer unused development potential to the areas immediately served by the Expo Light Rail. The 5-7 story height profile proposed by the DCP is framed by 4-story transition zones that gradually reduce height and scale at Downtown\u2019s outer edges where it abuts the residential neighborhoods of Wilmont and Mid-City, and where views of the Pacific Ocean open up on Ocean Avenue.", "The development standards for the Plan\u2019s six land use districts (Bayside Conservation, Neighborhood Village, Transit Adjacent, Lincoln Transition, Wilshire Transition, Ocean Transition) derive from the urban design strategy and provide equilibrium between the community\u2019s desire to protect the historic scale of Downtown\u2019s central walking area centered on the Third Street Promenade with the need to accommodate additional residential and commercial activities in areas that are regionally connected by transit.", "Downtown Land Use Districts", "Land Use", "Downtown\u2019s vibrancy is attributed to its unique mix of shops, restaurants, offices, institutions, health and well-being centers, entertainment venues, markets, apartments, and dozens of other offerings that are used daily by locals, employees and visitors. As the expanded boundaries of Downtown begin to transition into a mixed-use environment, the DCP provides a logical structure for regulating land uses in a way that is complimentary to the urban design strategy by directing the most intensive pedestrian-oriented uses to the historic core and transit area, and limiting the presence of larger more regionally-sized commercial uses adjacent to residential areas.", "This framework supports the DCP\u2019s Land Use Regulations, which are finely-tuned to balance the Downtown\u2019s various roles as urban neighborhood, regional job center and visitor destination.", "Urban Form and Building Design", "Santa Monica is renowned as a center of innovation and creativity, often leading the region - if not the nation \u2013 on issues of sustainability, community enrichment and urban policy. These practices are woven throughout many adopted City documents, such as the Zoning Ordinance, that influence building design both in our commercial areas as well as in our residential neighborhoods.", "In Downtown, the City has the opportunity to embody these principles in a new urban typology that celebrates architectural expression through flexible design standards. The DCP departs from the rigid formulas of the past several decades that have produced \u201cwedding cake\u201d buildings, and instead employs a suite of percentage-based modulation requirements that allow for an architectural concept to drive building design. These standards, which ensure a consistent pedestrian-scaled streetwall, interior access to light and air, and communal open spaces for building residents, provide designers with a comfortable canvas for exemplary architecture while empowering planners and reviewing bodies with sufficient criteria to evaluate the merit of individual projects. In response to comments received from the design community during the Planning Commission\u2019s deliberations on the draft DCP, avenues for alternative compliance or modifications to standards along with strategic exemptions from standards for single lot projects were added to the Planning Commission\u2019s recommended changes.", "The Architectural Review Board (ARB) discussed the Downtown Community Plan at both their June 5, 2017 and June 19, 2017 meetings and generally endorsed the urban design strategy and urban form approach. There was a robust exchange of ideas including discussion of design standards, modulation standards and design guidelines, the Bayside Conservation District and attention to potential historic resources and Landmark properties, open space provisions, as well as other aspects of the plan. The ARB Subcommittee also made many specific recommendations, identifying conflicts within the plan that needed clarification, and highlighting technical architectural items to be addressed with greater precision. These items have been addressed in the staff-recommended Addenda (Attachment C).", "The ARB is generally supportive of the Downtown Community plan presented. The ARB had a particular interest and concern regarding the modulation standards and were focused on ensuring the adopted standards do not prevent or hinder innovation and/or excellence in design. To that end, the ARB would like to support the following implementation actions:", "\u00b7 Add to Chapter 6, Implementation Actions a report on whether the development standards have resulted in desired outcomes.

The proposal would allow \u201cforms, geometries, and skins such as layered facades and brise-soleils that do not fit the modulation standards but generally conform to the intent for three-dimensional design and to ensure light and air into buildings and down to the street to be considered on a case-by-case basis through discretionary review.\u201d To this point, staff notes that the Plan already allows for architectural projections beyond the building frontage line for 2/3 of the fa\u00e7ade and therefore, believes the forms and geometries contemplated by the ARB subcommittee would be accommodated within the Plan\u2019s allowable projections.", "Key Concepts", "The Downtown Community Plan is a Housing Plan", "The Downtown Community Plan\u2019s primary responsibility is to respond to the direction of the LUCE to encourage the growth of the residential population Downtown. This strategic land use emphasis is intended to accommodate the unmet demand for new housing in Santa Monica by directing the production of over 2,500 new units to an area that is rich with public transportation options and where higher densities can support a more sustainable development pattern. The primacy of housing development is highlighted in the DCP by policy and Plan standards that provide incentives to encourage the production of new housing units, both market-rate and affordable to people of lower incomes.

Most of the new housing projects will include a healthy mix of unit sizes and affordability levels based on the DCP\u2019s policy direction and project requirements. It is important to note that 2,500 new units is a projection, not an absolute number, and could be increased upwards due to market forces that favor housing production over other land uses, such as commercial office or retail.", "The DCP\u2019s housing strategy and project requirements were reviewed by the Housing Commission at meetings on June 15, 2017 and June 20, 2017. The Housing Commission endorses most aspects of the DCP\u2019s housing approach including incentives for 100% affordable housing projects. However, the Housing Commission recommends that additional project or process requirements be contemplated further. Many of these recommendations include changes to proposed measures in the Plan including", "\u00b7 Eliminating CUP requirement for SRO projects", "\u00b7 Rejecting the process incentives for housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission", "\u00b7 Prohibiting any offsite affordable housing within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway", "\u00b7 Ensuring that the Housing Element Quantified Objective and Proposition R production requirements have been met before middle-income units (130%-180% AMI as indicated in DCP) could be considered in development agreement negotiations", "The inclusion of SRO projects as a permitted use is a change that will be reflected in the use table. The streamlined process for typical housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission was based on the need to create a clear and predictable process for housing projects as compared to commercial projects. To provide context to the location of offsite affordable housing, the Planning Commission discussed the limitation of residential uses within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway but did not impose any locational restrictions. Further, much of the Transit Adjacent district is within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway. Development agreement negotiations are conducted on a case-by-case basis so there would be no obligation to include any middle-income units.", "The Housing Commission also made several recommendations that extend beyond the scope of what has been in the public discourse or in proposals presented by staff or the community, including:", "\u00b7 A graduated affordable housing requirement that escalates up to 35% based on allowable height and FAR thresholds", "\u00b7 Eliminating any office or retail uses above the ground floor for new buildings, with exceptions for areas that the Council deems appropriate.", "\u00b7 Applying project requirements (i.e. affordability mix and average bedroom factor) to offsite 100% affordable housing projects with an exemption from the requirements only if necessary to obtain other forms of public financing", "\u00b7 Biennial review of DCP Affordable Housing and AHPP requirements to determine if new incentives or requirements should be instituted", "\u00b7 Encouraging ground floor residential units to have a preference for low-income disabled persons and artists, subject to City Attorney review regarding any fair housing implications", "\u00b7 Reviewing the entire AHPP now for consistency with Prop R income targeting and rent limits and revise the affordability requirements outside of Downtown based upon new feasibility studies similar to that conducted for the DCP", "\u00b7 Increasing deed-restriction terms on affordable units from 55 years to the life of the project", "\u00b7 Identifying publically-owned land as a potential resource to achieve affordable housing goals", "Staff appreciates the thoughtful detail that the Housing Commission put into their recommendations, some of which fall outside of the regulatory framework of the DCP in terms of deed restriction term limits and the framework of the AHPP.", "Staff defers to Council on the subject of modified affordable housing requirements, but notes that a careful balance has been struck within the DCP between project requirements, fees, and process. Any recommendation must also be supported by the HR&A feasibility analysis. The elimination of office or retail space above the ground floor may appear attractive as a means to create housing projects but prohibiting office and retail above the ground floor must be carefully considered in balance with other uses that are vital to the City\u2019s economy, social services network, or other important land uses that create a complete community.", "The draft DCP proposes that offsite affordable housing projects must be owned in whole or part and operated by a non-profit housing provider. It is likely that these providers will seek public financing that will dictate the affordability requirements of the project, which is why the DCP exempts 100% affordable housing projects from the project requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3 projects. However, there may be an instance where an offsite affordable housing project is completely privately financed. In this case, the project would still be required to comply with the definition of a 100% affordable housing project per Section 9.52.020.0050 of the Zoning Ordinance (25% of units affordable to 60% income households with remainder affordable to 80% income households). From a policy perspective, the net result is more affordable housing units and therefore, flexibility should be provided in how the offsite affordable housing is achieved. With respect to preference for artists, a new policy has also been included to explore accommodating artists within ground floor residential units provided the classifications do not result in unintended discriminatory impacts.", "The DCP includes a monitoring requirement that would produce a report concurrent with the LUCE monitoring. The monitoring report would include data presented as part of the Proposition R annual reports. Staff does not support a requirement that the DCP affordable housing requirements be reviewed every two years as there may not be sufficient data points to inform such a study.", "The Preservation of Existing Buildings is Strongly Supported", "Preserving the historic scale and character of Downtown\u2019s beloved walking areas is a central objective of the DCP\u2019s change strategy, which seeks to carefully retain many older structures that evoke nostalgia for Santa Monica\u2019s colorful past. The DCP improves upon previous historic preservation policies, and provides substantial support for adaptive reuse. A six-step approach outlines a variety of economic and technical incentives.", "Adaptive Reuse Incentives", "Exemptions from standard development requirements have been added to the DCP that create economic and technical incentives for owners of properties identified as City Designated Historic Resources or as potential historic resources. Several examples include exemptions from development standards, such as parking, open space, and certain use regulations that would create barriers to adaptive reuse. It should be noted that other technical incentives are available such as the California Historical Building Code, which recognizes older buildings often need alternative methods in meeting fire and life safety requirements.", "Protections for Historic Resources", "A new protection included in the DCP is an action to submit the Downtown Historic Resource Inventory (HRI) to the State Office of Historic Preservation, which would mean that all HRI-listed properties are considered presumptive historic resources under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires that exterior alterations to historic resources comply with the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. If alterations are not in conformance or demolition is proposed, more detailed environmental review of the proposed project would be required, possibly including an Environmental Impact Report.", "Several new process changes are also included in the DCP to facilitate the conservation of City Designated Historic Resources and potential historic resources Downtown. These include modified demolition screening procedures that require Landmarks Commission review of demolition permits for structures more than 40 years old and clearance of the required 75-day waiting period before any Planning application can be submitted. This new procedure would serve as a means to identify potential historic resources prior to the submittal of an application, which would be complemented with an associated amendment to SMMC Article 8 (Building Regulations) to increase the lifespan for demolition applications. Future actions to support this process change include updating the Landmarks Ordinance to provide alternative pathways to designation and the creation of a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District within the Bayside Conservation District to identify design features that provide visual identity to 2nd and 4th Streets. Special standards for the Bayside Conservation District include eliminating the open space requirements and relaxed modulation requirements in order to clearly define the traditional streetwall of 2nd and 4th Streets.", "The Landmarks Commission reviewed the DCP\u2019s approach to Historic Preservation at their June 12, 2017 meeting and supports the approach subject to the following recommended changes:", "\u00b7 Specify possible funding sources for historic preservation", "\u00b7 Assure that the existing provisions in the Municipal Code for expediting plan check occur in practice", "\u00b7 Increase outreach and public education regarding historic preservation", "\u00b7 Amend Policy HP2.4 to read, \u201cAdaptive reuse of older building should be considered for new construction and rehabilitation projects, when the scale, materials or method of construction evokes Downtown\u2019s history, and where the fa\u00e7ade building contributes to a continuous streetscape.\u201d", "Staff supports the Landmarks Commission\u2019s recommendations and has added relevant changes to the recommended Addenda. Going forward, staff will continue to look for opportunities to realize existing incentives for historic preservation, and to help expand outreach on this subject.", "New Public and Open Spaces are Prioritized throughout Downtown", "Because Downtown was largely developed as a commercial district it contains very few dedicated public spaces where groups can congregate. While many of the existing parks or public spaces that are utilized by Downtown residents and visitors are located nearby in other districts (e.g. Tongva Park, Palisades Park, Reed Park); within Downtown, only the public right of way, and places like the Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Place, and the Santa Monica Main Library serve as Downtown\u2019s dedicated public open space offerings. Recognizing this, the community overwhelmingly identified the maintenance, enhancement or creation of public space as the #1 priority for Downtown\u2019s evolution.", "The DCP looks at the public space network comprehensively, and acknowledges that a nuanced approach that involves both City and private interests must be considered. To this end, the Plan emphasizes the role that private development must play to add new public spaces to Downtown. The DCP identifies key sites where development has been proposed and where negotiations with property owners may yield significant public open space. Similarly, the Public Space plan includes existing publically-accessible spaces (\u201cPOPs\u201d) that should be redesigned to promote better access and programming, perhaps incentivized with a small modicum of new floor area. Management and oversight of these spaces is paramount, and will require the involvement of City staff, DTSM and private property owners.", "Based on outreach, smaller scale public spaces such as pocket parks, courtyards and plazas are preferred over larger open spaces such as a central park or recreation fields. Additionally, the quality of Downtown\u2019s streetscapes is to be improved to emphasize their role as public spaces and the opportunity they provide to further pedestrianize the area through wider sidewalks, a larger more verdant urban forest, and street furnishings that would make the walking experience more enjoyable.", "Private Open Space in Housing Projects", "A new feature of the DCP\u2019s zoning standards is the requirement for typical housing projects to provide on-site open space for residents\u2019 use. Depending on the size of the project area, a project is required to dedicate 20-25% of the total lot area to courtyards, rooftop gardens, balconies and other open space types, and of this percentage one-quarter must be designed for communal use. Single-lot projects are exempt from these standards.", "The Recreation and Parks Commission (RPC) reviewed the DCP\u2019s Public Space approach at their December 15, 2016 meeting and subsequently provided a letter expressing unanimous support for the various approaches and policies surrounding the creation or enhancement of public open spaces Downtown. The RPC conditioned their support on several recommendations, including:", "\u00b7 That the DCP maximize every opportunity to create open space, including true green space, courtyards, plazas and paseos;", "\u00b7 That the DCP identify parcels that would be suitable for acquisition for open space use;", "\u00b7 That the DCP include policies reflecting the need to work with private property owners to activate empty plazas;", "\u00b7 That ground floor open space be included in all residential projects;", "\u00b7 That projects subject to DAs provide substantial open space benefits and that property owners should be held accountable for maintaining open space amenities to the highest levels.", "Nearly all of the RPC\u2019s recommendations have been addressed and incorporated into the final draft DCP. The one exception is the recommendation to require ground floor open space, which was not integrated into the final plan as it would conflict with the broader urban design strategy to maintain a consistent streetwall at the ground floor.", "Encouraging Economic Vitality is Important to Downtown\u2019s Future", "Downtown is a major employment center (approx. 25,000 jobs) and a revenue generator that supports the many programs, services and activities that residents citywide have come to enjoy. While constituting only 4.5% of the City, Downtown\u2019s generates over a third of the total sales tax revenues for Santa Monica, and another third of all hotel room revenues citywide. Additionally, fees collected from development to fund park maintenance, childcare programs, urban runoff projects, and transportation enhancements are largely drawn from projects located in Downtown. The combination of these elements has helped Downtown, and the city as a whole, weather challenging financial crises such as the Great Recession.", "Given its prominence as Silicon Beach and a major tourist destination, one of Downtown\u2019s inherent tensions is the degree to which it caters to locals, employees and visitors alike. The challenge ahead is to ensure that it remains a place for everyone, and that opportunities for economic diversity are embraced. The DCP weaves together policies and standards that create a \u201clocal business-friendly\u201d environment that can provide space for a broad mix of job opportunities in new and expanding industries whether they be creative office and co-working spaces, retail, dining and entertainment, or hospitality. The Promenade is further supported through a variety of exemptions from design standards to allow for greater flexibility, and through a change to several regulations that currently restrict uses. Going forward, an Action of the DCP is to work with Public Works and DTSM, Inc. on a Promenade improvement project to enhance its infrastructure, lighting and right-of-way features.", "In the course of outreach, a clear preference emerged to support the creative economy, and to expand opportunities for local entrepreneurialism with small and medium-sized businesses. To this end, the draft DCP includes a variety of changes from the zoning ordinance that are intended to reduce regulatory barriers for small businesses and typical changes of use. These include relaxed parking standards and less restrictive use regulations that ensure ground floor uses reflect the appropriate level of activity based on adjacency to residential uses.", "The Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Board of Directors (DTSM) conducted a comprehensive review of the draft DCP and while there is agreement on many of the key approaches, there remains concern regarding the distribution of heights and densities across Downtown and the effect on housing production. DTSM highlighted six key recommendations for the Council\u2019s consideration:", "\u00b7 Increase height and FAR in the BC and NV districts to 84 feet and FAR of 4.0 and to 60 feet and FAR of 2.75 for both sides of the Lincoln Transition district.", "\u00b7 Provide streamlined process for granting flexibility from all aspects of retail space design and configuration standards to respond to the shifting retail environment.", "\u00b7 Include a clear vision for a new state-of-the-art movie theater on the site of either Parking Structure #1 or #3.", "\u00b7 Support for allowing ground floor office in midblock locations in the Neighborhood Village district as demand may not be sufficient to support retail in these locations resulting in vacancies detrimental to the neighborhood.", "\u00b7 Include a clear statement on improvements to vehicle circulation with inclusion of a Vehicle Action Plan, similar in scope to Bike and Pedestrian Action Plans.", "\u00b7 Consider flexibility in desired widths for sidewalk zones in order to accommodate space for outdoor dining.", "As discussed later in the report highlighting issues for Council consideration, policy options are presented to address housing production and ground floor office in Neighborhood Village midblock locations. The proposed heights and FARs in the Plan have been carefully crafted within the context of the urban design strategy to place the highest intensities closest to the Expo Station and to balance new development with the existing character of Downtown.", "DTSM\u2019s recommendations on a modification process for retail configuration are already included in the draft Plan. Language regarding support for movie theaters is also included in the Addenda. The sidewalk widths in the Plan are provided as conceptual illustrations and will be more comprehensively reviewed as part of the follow-up action to create a Downtown Streetscape Manual for how the public right-of-way is used and managed. As discussed in the following section, the Plan proposes a comprehensive Mobility approach that addresses improvements for all modes.", "A New Model for Mobility: Improving Today, Preparing for the Future", "A new model for mobility includes making more transportation options attractive, convenient, affordable, and safer so that people feel they can circulate without driving alone. It is an evolution of how people get to Downtown, and how they experience traveling within Downtown. The creation of parking structures may have revived Downtown, Expo service has provided a new transit option, while the future is expected to include travel by driverless vehicles.", "The \u2018park once, pedestrians first\u2019 mantra has been a guiding tenet for the past 30 years in Downtown. Recently Expo light rail service, pedestrian scramble intersections, a bike center, bicycle lanes and bike share have been introduced to Downtown. The next phase will likely see more changes related to car service (Lyft, Uber, taxi), increasing demand for curb space, and technology. Success of the area is tied to the success of the pedestrian environment \u2013 continuing to be a place that residents and visitors both want to walk from place to place.", "Transportation in Downtown is as diverse as the people who travel there. Downtown is a place that welcomes the service workers who make it function, as much as resident visitors and tourists \u2013 who may take a bus, ride the train, drive with friends, or take a tour bus. People come in buses, carpools, on foot and by bike and walk throughout the district. Providing a quality transportation experience requires flexibility to make it more effective for all of these roadway users. This includes measuring our performance in making streets serve people first, and prioritizing modes that are more efficient.", "A new focus in the DCP is the quickly-evolving technology influence on transportation, including electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and transit service provided by private organizations. Since the inception of the development of this plan, car services, have gained widespread acceptance. The City\u2019s response must be internal, by shaping choices so that the convenient option also meets community values, and external, by actively participating in the field of changing technology. The plan includes recommendations to work with businesses to provide micro-transit, to use technology to provide on-demand transit service, to focus on community priorities such as equitable access to autonomous vehicles, and to participate in regional transportation technology efforts. A new model for mobility requires changes to policies, new investments, different requirements for property owners, adapting business practices, and partnership with the Santa Monica community.", "Art and Cultural Offerings Create New Opportunities Downtown", "The demand for new and more diverse art, cultural and entertainment activities is increasing Downtown. To establish Downtown\u2019s identity as a major cultural center, the City must carefully consider new opportunities for cultural engagement to stretch Downtown\u2019s vibrancy. Building from the traditionally retail-centered economic base, events, major artworks, unique creative expressions and live music will infuse the street and public spaces to strengthen Santa Monica\u2019s as a cultural destination. Additional entertainment choices Downtown, particularly nighttime venues, will provide residents, employees and visitors with a wider array of destination experiences than in the past, such as live performance spaces for theater and live music. The Arts Commission supports the DCP\u2019s approach to Art and Culture.", "The DCP\u2019s land use regulations now permit a larger range of art and cultural uses than historically permitted in the past. The Plan includes an invitation to potential museum operators to work with the City to locate a museum Downtown, and identifies several locations where major works of public art could be located.", "At its November 21, 2016 meeting the Arts Commission enthusiastically supported the inclusion of arts and culture into the DCP, and offered the several recommendations, which have largely been incorporated into the final Plan:", "\u00b7 Encourage policies and public/private partnerships that promote robust artistic activities throughout downtown, in businesses, open spaces and vacant storefronts.", "\u00b7 Support Creative Placemaking efforts that enhance other city goals, such as mobility and activating open spaces.", "\u00b7 Wherever possible, the DCP should ease restrictions and streamline procedures to facilitate pop-up art interventions in underutilized spaces.", "\u00b7 Encourage the development of public and public/private open space, and provide incentives for artists and arts groups to work with City Cultural Affairs staff to develop and implement art and Creative Placemaking programs downtown.", "\u00b7 Position Downtown Santa Monica as a cultural destination", "\u00b7 Expand options for live music and the performing arts in downtown facilities and businesses.", "\u00b7 Of the affordable housing that is produced Downtown, 10% of the units should be designed and set aside for artist housing or live/work units.", "The DCP directly addresses all of the recommendations of the Arts Commission through its policy framework and subsequent implementation actions with the exception of the Arts Commission\u2019s recent request that artist housing or live/work units be included as part of the DCP\u2019s affordable housing requirements. Additional refinements have been recorded in the recommended Addenda that reflect specific direction on certain actions.", "Community Wellbeing", "The City\u2019s Wellbeing Project looks beyond traditional performance measures or economic indicators and uses a new method to gain an understanding of how all of these factors interact and affect residents\u2019 quality of life. The core of the project is the Wellbeing Index, which provides the City with a snapshot of its current wellbeing strengths and needs by analyzing data collected from residents, city departments and social media to gain a robust understanding of how the people of Santa Monica are doing across multiple measures known to influence wellbeing.", "The Wellbeing Index demonstrates that Downtown residents benefit from many positive dimensions, such as access to healthy food, proximity to culturally enriching experiences and institutions, use and enjoyment of Downtown\u2019s outdoor spaces, and frequent use of the many mobility options provided. However, the Index also points to areas of concern that highlight the growing pains of a residential neighborhood in its infancy. The metrics for stress, stability and life/work balance all register slightly higher Downtown than any other neighborhood in the city. One indicator of particular concern to the planning team reveals that Downtown residents do not feel connected to one another in the way that fosters community, trust among neighbors, and social interaction. Tying the results of the Index to Plan policies and standards strengthens the logic for prioritizing affordable housing, public open space, new neighborhood serving uses, youth and senior services, and many others.", "The Social Services Commission submitted their recommendations to the Planning Commission on April 26, 2017. Specifically, the Social Services Commission recommended the use of the Wellbeing Project data to guide development agreement negotiations and be used as a tool to advance a diverse and multigenerational Downtown community, support for affordable housing, and specificity for policies supporting wraparound community and social services to serve the Downtown community. Recommendations that development projects include setasides for affordable/low-cost office space and community rooms could not be included due to lack of nexus between such requirements and new development; however, such amenities could be included in negotiated projects. Many of the Social Services Commission\u2019s recommendations were included in the Planning Commission\u2019s final recommendation on the DCP.", "B. IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING THE PLAN", "Implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility. Chapter 6 outlines all actions in the Plan along with a relative estimate of cost, responsibility, timing, and potential funding sources (Table 6.1 of the draft Plan). This can used as a budgeting tool and also as a means to support grant applications. Table 6.1 demonstrates that implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility dependent on not only City leadership but also coordination with community partnerships and cooperation from private entities.", "The DCP monitoring report will be prepared concurrent with the LUCE 5-year Measuring and Monitoring Report. One key area that will be monitored is the development cap of 3.2M square feet of net new floor area in Downtown. This development cap represents the amount of new development that could occur that would still allow achievement of the LUCE goal of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips. Any project proposal that exceeds the cap would not be able to be approved until additional environmental analysis and amendments have been completed. There are also other indicators to monitor the performance of the DCP listed on Page 247-249 of the draft Plan.", "CHAPTER 2: PLAN DEVELOPMENT", "A. COMMUNITY OUTREACH", "Many years of outreach have marked the development of the DCP. Interdepartmental staff and the planning team have worked with community stakeholders and the City\u2019s Boards and Commissions to tackle challenging issues in search of consensus, and have listened intently to the perspectives brought forward by the many voices involved in shaping the Plan.", "Beginning in 2012, outreach on the DCP has taken on many forms, from workshops on Emerging Themes, Community Benefits, and Urban form, to stakeholder interviews and meetings with the Planning Commission and City Council. In total, seven workshops were held to drill into Plan concepts and generate feedback from the community. At the onset of 2016, staff re-engaged the community on a variety of topics to move closer towards consensus and to refine the Plan.", "2016 Outreach and Engagement", "Beginning shortly after the Planning Commission\u2019s March 2nd, 2016 meeting, staff launched an unprecedented outreach campaign to community groups and local organizations, employing the City\u2019s Office of Communications as a partner in diversifying the input opportunities and in reaching new voices within the community. The outreach tools and platforms used to engage thousands of people were expansive and yielded greater detail about the community\u2019s preference for things like open space, art and culture, mobility, jobs and housing and historic preservation. Importantly, the outreach also demonstrated that there are a great many perspectives on height, development and planning for large sites that have the ability to support much desired amenities.", "A detailed breakdown of the 2016 outreach and supporting documentation is provided in the November 16, 2016 Planning Commission staff report. Below is a snapshot of last year\u2019s outreach by the numbers:", "\u00b7 1,200 people provided feedback on Downtown priorities in workshops, focus groups and online", "\u00b7 Over 40 community presentations were given to local groups and organizations in both English and Spanish", "\u00b7 7 community conversation focus groups were held at the Main Public Library and at Senior Residences Downtown", "\u00b7 3 public workshops were held on the subjects of Placemaking, Preservation and Change and Mobility", "\u00b7 3 Downtown walking tours were co-hosted by the planning team and the Santa Monica Conservancy", "\u00b7 4.6 million social media impressions were recorded on facebook, twitter and instagram", "\u00b7 8,700 unique visits to the DCP website, www.downtownsmplan.org", "Leading up to the release of the 2017 Final Draft Downtown Community Plan, staff held several events to provide a broad overview into the content of the Plan and to establish a rapport with interested community members who sought clarifications on key subjects or who had questions about the collective vision for Downtown\u2019s future.", "B. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS", "In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared that analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP. The Draft Program EIR was circulated for a 90 day public review period beginning on February 3, 2016 (exceeding the minimum 45-day public review as required by Section 15067 of the CEQA Guidelines). In addition, a Recirculated Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period in February 2017 to reflect changes that were made to the draft DCP.", "Comments on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR included public concerns about development in Downtown, the Miramar established large site, height, traffic, aesthetics, and neighborhood character. The Final EIR provides written responses to all comments received on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR. Some minor text changes and clarification were also included in the Final EIR.", "The Final EIR analyzes the effect of potential land use changes that could occur in the Downtown through 2030 as a result of the implementation of the DCP, including review of the range of impacts between two different buildout scenarios. Scenario A (High Scenario) would entail higher FARs for sites in the Downtown with variation by district, and represents the City Council\u2019s outside parameters for EIR analysis established during the August 13, 2013 meeting, which includes FARs up to 5.0 for the established large sites. Scenario B has a lower range of FARs, with up to 4.0 FAR for the established large sites. Scenario B represents a maximum cap of 3.22 million sf of net new floor area in the Downtown.", "The Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts for air quality, construction effects, construction noise, cultural resources, and traffic. Specifically because the details of specific future projects occurring in the Downtown are unknown, the Final EIR concludes that construction-related air emissions and noise (vibration) would be significant and unavoidable. Furthermore, although the DCP would establish greater preservation policies and standards, the Final EIR concludes that historic impacts would be significant and unavoidable since individual projects could involve the demolition or alteration of a historic resource. Additionally, due to the City\u2019s stringent thresholds for traffic and the existing levels of traffic in Downtown, the Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts with respect to traffic (automobile delay). Aesthetic impacts of the DCP, including those due to building height, are considered less than significant pursuant to Section 21099 of the CEQA Statute, which states that aesthetic impacts of residential, mixed use, and employment center projects in transit priority areas are considered less than significant.", "Most importantly, the Final EIR concludes that Scenario B of the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions, which is consistent with the intent of SB743 and upcoming changes to CEQA. Additionally, as noted in the Final EIR, the DCP implements the sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction goals and policies established in the City\u2019s LUCE, Sustainable City Plan, Climate Action Plan, and SCAG\u2019s Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The DCP is based on a vision of supporting and enhancing the Downtown as a multi-modal district that is fully integrated with the Downtown Station of the Expo LRT. The DCP also emphasizes new land uses in areas proximate to the Downtown Station to minimize vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled, and associated GHG emissions. Additionally, the Plan would enhance multi-modal relationships, calling for new connections and circulation improvements for all modes as well as aggressive TDM measures such as employer trip reduction plans and subsidized transit passes or transportation allowances for residents and employees. Collectively, the standards, policies, and programs in the DCP would support sustainability and GHG reduction goals established by the State, region, and City.", "As required under CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a), the Final EIR includes a discussion and evaluation of \"a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.\" The EIR provides a robust analysis of the DCP as well the following alternatives. The alternatives analysis provides City decision-makers with a reasonable range of alternatives to consider to reduce or avoid impacts.", "\u00b7 Alternative 1 \u2013 No Project Alternative;", "\u00b7 Alternative 2 \u2013 Reduced Project (Elimination of Tier 3) Alternative;", "\u00b7 Alternative 3 \u2013 4th/5th Streets On-Way Streets Circulation Plan;", "\u00b7 Alternative 4 \u2013 Expanded One-way Streets Circulation Plan; and", "\u00b7 Alternative 5 \u2013 Hotel/Tourism-focused Land Use Mix Alternative.", "CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR identify the Environmentally Superior Alternative to the proposed project from among the alternatives analyzed. If the No Project Alternative is found to be environmentally superior alternative, the EIR also identifies an Environmentally Superior Alternative from among the other alternatives. For a broad policy document such as the DCP, the potential exists that there may not be a clear Environmentally Superior Alternative. An alternative may have some reduced impact levels and other impacts that are greater than the project, while another alternative reduces different impacts. Although CEQA does not provide specific guidance in this matter, where a project has lower impacts in a majority of resource areas and/or substantially lower impacts in especially critical resource areas, this can support a finding that that alternative is environmentally superior.", "Alternative 2 (Elimination of Tier 3 Projects) would reduce transportation-related impacts on intersections; however, elimination of Tier 3 developments would substantially reduce community benefits and substantial affordable housing and multi-modal transportation investment opportunities within the Downtown, potentially resulting in increased vehicles miles traveled. Therefore, in comparing an incremental reduction in the severity of significant impacts with the achievement of Project goals and objectives, the EIR determined that the implementation of Scenario B of the DCP would be the environmentally superior alternative. Implementation of Scenario B would incrementally reduce potential environmental impacts relative to Scenario A, but implementation of Scenario B would also still achieve all of the goals and objectives of the DCP.", "The Final EIR was presented to Planning Commission for review in April 2017, who recommended certification of the Final EIR. Adoption of the DCP would require Council certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and the mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR. Mitigation measures are identified in the Final EIR in the areas of Air Quality, Biological Resources, Construction Effects (Air Quality), Cultural Resources, Hazards/Hazardous Materials, Public Services, Utilities, and Transportation and Circulation. To ensure that these measures are properly enacted, a mitigation monitoring program is necessary and will be enforced during the construction and operation of the project.", "C. PLANNING COMMISSION COMMENTS ON THE PLAN", "During the months of April and May 2017 the Planning Commission held six public hearings to discuss the DCP (April 25, May 10, May 11, May 17, May 18 and May 31) and its Program Environmental Impact Report. These meetings, which spanned over 40 hours of discussion, also provided the opportunity for the community to comment on the Plan\u2019s content, and for staff to clarify concepts. The Commission recommended adoption of the DCP with specific amendments and modifications that are listed in Exhibit B to the adopting resolution (Attachment B). The modifications largely pertain to key development standards and Plan policy that encourage the production of housing, as well as the range and location of land uses that are desired for the area.", "Housing Production", "Among the productive clarifications to design standards, mobility actions, open space creation and well-being targets, the Planning Commission\u2019s most impactful recommendations were to increase several housing-related process thresholds to further stimulate housing production Downtown. Hence, the Commission has recommended that typical mixed-use housing projects up to 60,000 square feet, on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet, be processed ministerially through an Administrative Approval, which would greatly reduce the time necessary to process a development application. In the Transit Adjacent District, the only area in Downtown that has a Tier 3 option, the Commission recommends a Development Review Permit process for housing projects up to 90,000 square feet. This process threshold represents the amount of maximum allowable floor area that could result from a project located on a three-lot site of 22,500 square feet. The Planning Commission\u2019s recommendation was based on overall consensus that this area can support greater densities on account of proximity to the Expo Light Rail.", "Comparison of DCP to Planning Commission recommendations for Housing Project Review Process", "Permit Type", "DCP (April 2017)", "Planning Commission", "Administrative Approval", "Less than 30,000 SF", "Project on lots up to 15,000 SF (typically results in projects less than 60,000 SF)", "Development Review Permit", "All Tier 2 Tier 3 30,000 - 60,000 SF", "Tier 2 on lots over 15,000 SF", "Tier 3 on lots over 15,000 SF and up to 90,000 SF", "Development Agreement", "Tier 3 over 60,000 SF", "Tier 3 over 90,000 SF", "Established Large Site Standards and Process", "Lastly, the Commission spent considerable time discussing the DCP\u2019s options for the Established Large Sites, three sites within Downtown that - given their parcel size - could potentially provide significant community benefits for circulation, open space and cultural facilities that would otherwise not be anticipated from smaller projects. The inclusion of these sites into the Plan sparked the most extensive and spirited debate among Planning Commissioners. There was consideration of various modifications to the staff recommendation. In the end, without majority support for any particular approach to these sites, the Commission narrowly recommended (4-3 straw vote) the removal of the Established Large Site Overlay, which provides unique height and FAR standards for these sites.", "Commissioners who favored including the Established Large Site Overlay sought to establish the DCP as a comprehensive planning tool that creates clear parameters and expectations for projects on the three sites. The Commissioners also supported a transparent and rigorous public review process that requires a development agreement, additional environmental review, and includes special application requirements for the applicant to demonstrate how the project meets the DCP\u2019s objectives. The Commission discussed potentially reducing the maximum height to approximately 100 feet with a setback from Ocean Avenue. These Commissioners expressed concern about reviewing Specific Plan amendments for individual projects soon after adoption of the DCP.", "Commissioners who did not favor including the Established Large Site Overlay supported having the height and FAR standards in Chapter 4, Table 4.2 apply to all Downtown projects. These Commissioners expressed concern that District height limits should not be exceeded and authorizing greater height and FAR in the Plan would signal that increased height is acceptable. There was a desire to ensure that the appropriate form in Downtown is established first through the DCP\u2019s base standards and not influenced by community benefits and project amenities. These Commissioners agreed that applicants for each project should submit Specific Plan Amendments for review on a project-by-project basis.", "Similarly, the Commission rejected a selection of process options that would have required voter approval or a supermajority of Council to effect changes to the adopted DCP. The Commission was nearly unanimous (6-1 straw vote) in the belief that Council authority is sufficient to render decisions related to Plan amendments, and that the referendum process established in State law provides appropriate opportunities for voters to challenge Council\u2019s legislative actions.", "Access and Mobility", "The Planning Commission has actively provided feedback on the Access and Mobility chapter specific actions and overall approach. Following discussion with the Commission, the Plan now calls for preparing for emerging technologies that serves the community\u2019s vision, strengthens the plans consistency with Vision Zero, and updates parking policies that the Commission has since suggested amending. The Commission strongly communicated a desire to not only be forward-thinking but aggressive with implementation, as reflected in the errata sheet recommended by the Commission.", "The DCP addresses steps to ensure how technology can best be used to make Downtown\u2019s existing transportation network work better for people. The Plan includes an approach to making travel information easier to access through real-time information for transit service, bike share availability, travel times, and parking availability. A methodological use of information on parking and travel patterns can also be used to plan for and manage peak travel periods, which allow for having the right amount of people working at the right times to assist travelers and deployment of the most effective changes needed during peak travel periods.", "Technology is increasing the viability of shared rides, microtransit or privately owned transit, autonomous vehicles, and widespread acceptance of electric vehicles. The DCP provides direction on how technology can be integrated with transportation in Downtown and how Santa Monica can participate in guiding the development of these technologies in the region.", "Parking", "Climate change, traffic congestion, and changing usage patterns necessitate shifting parking policies. The Commission has affirmed the right-sizing and right-placing by having a discreet amount of new parking primarily on the periphery of Downtown. There has also been support for studying and then supporting private parking availability for the public.", "Parking related changes suggested to Council by the Planning Commission include:", "\u00b7 Creating a new parking district in the Zoning Ordinance specifically for the Downtown that supports preservation of buildings through greater flexibility when a use changes. The DCP parking requirements recommend a universal parking rate of 1 space per 500 square feet for all retail and restaurant uses under 5,000 square feet, parking rates are similarly adjusted for residential units.

SPOTLIGHT ISSUES FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION", "This section of the report identifies several \u201cspotlight\u201d issues for Council consideration that were raised in the course of the Planning Commission\u2019s deliberations on the DCP.", "Housing Production", "The DCP provides for ample housing production over the life of the Plan through a variety of process and technical incentives that are designed to steer development towards the creation of new residential units. These incentives include a .5 FAR bonus for housing projects over their commercial counterparts, as well as some additional height in the transition zones. Coupled with project requirements for new Affordable Housing, the DCP housing production incentives create the condition to achieve the forecasted minimum of 2,500 new units within the next 15 years. The possibility for additional square footage for housing exists within the volume of development contemplated in the Plan\u2019s EIR, potentially adding up to roughly 3,100 new units if less commercial, medical or institutional uses are proposed than originally forecasted.", "Recent criticism of the DCP\u2019s housing approach has raised the specter of the nationwide housing crisis with many proponents demanding higher heights and densities than currently proposed or even studied in the EIR. Public testimony and correspondence point to a sentiment that Santa Monica must do more to provide housing to those in need, even though the City is well on track to achieve or surpass its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) number given by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and that Downtown has the highest allowable FARs in the entire City.", "During the Planning Commission hearings, the Commission recommended several process and technical incentive changes that fast-track housing projects Downtown, such as an Administrative Approval process for typical two-lot projects that typically result in projects of approximately 5-6 stories and 60 units. The Commission also recommended a more permissive administrative threshold for 100% Affordable Housing projects and height and FAR increases for 100% Affordable Housing in the Neighborhood Village District.", "For Council Consideration: Should the Council wish to go beyond the DCP\u2019s recommended \u201chousing-first\u201d strategy, the following options are presented for consideration:", "Option 1: Increase process thresholds by which more housing projects would qualify for streamlined entitlements.", "Option 2: Further reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects (e.g. 10\u2019 and 0.5 FAR).", "Option 3: Require all projects on sites of greater than 15,000 square feet to have at least 50% of the floor area be residential uses, except for hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and the Third Street Promenade.", "Option 4: Increasing the height and FAR standards, subject to additional environmental evaluation", "Table of Supporting and Opposing Arguments for Each Policy Alternative", "Option", "Supporting Argument", "Opposing Argument", "1", "\u00b7 Provides significant time incentives for developers to seek housing", "\u00b7 Creates certainty for community and developer", "\u00b7 Perception of reduction in opportunities for public participation", "2", "\u00b7 Would clearly establish preference for housing projects by further reducing height and FAR for commercial projects", "\u00b7 Overall reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects was done for neighborhood transitions but implementing this strategy in Downtown core could have unintended consequence of affecting Downtown economic vitality", "3", "\u00b7 Guarantees that any larger project would be required to have 50% residential use, prohibiting strictly office and retail projects (exempting hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and buildings on the Third Street Promenade.", "\u00b7 Blanket standard that prescribes land use mix and reduces flexibility in land use decisions", "\u00b7 Proscriptive approach instead of providing incentives", "4", "\u00b7 Could result in potentially more than 2,500 new housing units if FAR standards are increased", "\u00b7 Would not result in substantially more housing units", "\u00b7 Inconsistent with urban design strategy proposed in DCP and widely discussed and endorsed by the community", "Staff Recommendation", "Staff recommends further process incentives be considered as described in Option 1, as they would provide clear project requirements with predictable timelines established in DCP. The Planning Commission recommended that an Administrative Approval process would be appropriate for projects on sites no greater than 15,000 square feet. The Commission also recommended that a Development Review Permit would be appropriate for Tier 3 projects no greater than 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District. This was intended to allow typical housing projects that are similar in size and scale to housing projects that already exist in the Downtown leaving larger projects subject to Planning Commission review.", "As a further process incentive, Council could establish a higher threshold for Administrative Approvals (AA) that would provide predictability to applicants with respect to number of housing units authorized, amount of affordable housing units required, affordability level of units, open space requirements, and certainty in applicable development standards. The Administrative Approval (AA) process provides certainty that the project will be approved if it meets all of the DCP\u2019s project requirements. This class of housing projects would be required to obtain a recommendation from the ARB before the AA could be approved and would still need to obtain final approval on the project design from the ARB. This process is similar to the procedural incentives that were formerly in place for Downtown in the 1990s that resulted in the production of approximately 2,500 housing units over the course of three decades. The significant difference is the DCP has a variety of development standards in place that are intended to ensure that projects not only complement Downtown\u2019s existing character but also contribute to the implementation of Downtown as a vibrant, walkable place that welcomes a diverse population of all income levels.", "Established Large Sites", "The Planning Commission\u2019s narrow recommendation to remove the Established Large Site Overlay from the DCP points to the divergence of opinions surrounding tall buildings in Downtown Santa Monica. Outreach to the community on this subject was balanced at opposite ends, with roughly 50% in favor and another 50% opposed. Those in favor of the Overlay, which would allow three projects to propose building heights up to 130\u2019 within an established planning framework, argued that the potential benefits for open space, historic preservation, and mobility outweighed potential negative impacts associated with shade/shadow and scale. Those opposed to the Overlay expressed concern that Santa Monica\u2019s identity as a low-scale coastal community would be compromised by tall buildings, and further \u2013 that the DCP\u2019s standards should reflect a level playing field for all development, and not single out a few exceptions.", "For Council Consideration: Should the DCP include the Established Large Site Overlay, which would authorize consideration of height up to 130 feet and additional FAR on three sites in Downtown?", "Staff Recommendation on Height for Established Large Sites", "The concept of the Established Large Site Overlay presented in the draft DCP seeks to establish clear expectations in terms of maximum height, appropriate FAR, and open space requirements for three sites in Downtown. The proposal also establishes a rigorous review process that requires a development agreement application and includes additional environmental review and a comprehensive application that demonstrates how the project meets DCP priorities. No Specific Plan Amendment would be required. As legislative actions, development agreements would be subject to the voter approval process already established in State law.", "Staff believes that there are site-specific reasons why allowing for additional height would lead to superior outcomes for future development on these sites. Staff also believes that imposing a clear maximum height for future projects on those sites provides clarity and coherence to protect the integrity of the overall plan that would be absent if property owners/developers could seek consideration for essentially unlimited heights for projects on those sites \u2013 or could seek additional heights on sites where positive trade-offs simply do not apply. Allowing the projects to move forward with the 130\u2019 height would allow flexibility for more ground level public space, preservation of historic buildings and features (currently on two of the three sites) and the opportunity for more distinctive and functional architectural massing, modulation and design.", "Options for Established Large Site Floor Area Ratio (FAR)", "Each of the Established Large Sites have individual FAR parameters, which dictate the mass and scale of the projects. While the proposed height of these projects has been the focus of discussions, the projects\u2019 FARs also have the potential to directly influence the project and community benefits that could be achieved on these three sites. Should Council seek options for exploring revised FARs for these sites, staff proposes three options for consideration:", "Option 1: Maintain the DCP\u2019s existing individual FAR parameters for the Established Large Sites, which were originally presented in the 2014 version of the DCP, and in all subsequent drafts leading up to the final DCP. Were this option to be adopted, it would reflect the original development parameters that have been consistently discussed throughout the multi-year public process of creating the DCP and the proposals that have been submitted to the City by the applicants.", "Option 2: Modify the DCP\u2019s FAR parameters such that all three Established Large Sites would be subject to a universal 3.0 FAR, which represents an average of the development potential across all three sites provided by the DCP\u2019s base development standards for each Zoning District. Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites and ensure that the development of all three Established Large Sites would not exceed the theoretical development potential of the total land area of all three sites were these parcels developed in a series of typical two- or three-lot projects as opposed to the larger block-level projects that have been proposed.", "Option 3: Modify the DCP\u2019s FAR parameters such that the FAR for each of the three sites would be limited to the maximum FAR established for each Zoning District averaged across the whole site.

The one area of the Downtown where commercial offices are permitted at the ground floor is in the Neighborhood Village District, where many existing ground floor offices, such as the Chamber of Commerce, are currently located.", "At its final hearing on the DCP, the Planning Commission voted to recommend that commercial office in the Neighborhood Village be limited to upper floors or at the rear of a project. Staff is concerned that this recommendation will render many existing offices non-conforming. Additionally, staff is concerned that there is not enough retail demand to justify the elimination of ground floor office (which includes \u201cwalk-in clientele\u201d), and could have the unwelcome effect of producing vacant storefronts.", "For Council Consideration: Should the Planning Commission\u2019s recommendation to eliminate all ground floor office from the Plan be adopted? If not, the following option is recommended by staff:", "Staff Recommendation", "Based on an existing land use survey of the Neighborhood Village District, offices currently make up approximately 45% of the ground floor street frontage. The Planning Commission\u2019s recommendation would make all of these ground floor uses non-conforming and replace them with potentially residential or retail uses as change occurs. A 2015 Downtown market outlook report that was used as a point of comparison for the Buildout Analysis demonstrated limits to the amount of retail space that could be feasibly supported in the DCP boundaries. The land use strategy in the DCP establishes the Neighborhood Village District as an area of mixed activity where non-active uses such as residential and office uses could be allowed on the ground floor in mid-block locations only. More active retail and restaurant spaces are strategically targeted for corner locations. The existing retail spaces in these mid-block locations have historically been difficult to lease and the ground floor non-active uses would likely have better compatibility with the residential uses that are anticipated in the district.", "B.

The Final DCP is the culmination of this engaging dialogue, and a record of the City\u2019s effort to balance the myriad priorities of a community that aspires to achieve the best outcome for our central heart of commercial, cultural and entertainment activity. There has largely been support for the Plan\u2019s overall approach. However, a plan of this significance inevitably highlights diverse views on the shape and scope of future new development in our community, including those who argue that the plan would allow too much growth in our Downtown and those who maintain it would overly restrict the supply of new housing.

The Program EIR analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP and identified mitigation measures necessary to reduce significant impacts. Additionally, the Program EIR analyzes alternatives to the DCP, including a No Project Alternative and a Reduced Project (Tier 2 only) Alternative. The Final EIR concludes that although there would be significant and unavoidable impacts, the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions.", "Background", "The Downtown Community Plan is a roadmap guiding the evolution of Downtown Santa Monica, a 229-acre area identified by the City\u2019s Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as bounded by Wilshire Boulevard and the I-10 Freeway, and between Lincoln Boulevard and Ocean Avenue. Taking into account that only 4% of the City lies within Downtown (roughly half a square mile), the DCP lays out a framework that integrates housing, jobs, mobility, historic preservation, public open space, infrastructure, and art and culture into a comprehensive long-term Plan. When adopted, the DCP will guide decision-makers and City departments, property owners and developers, as well as local stakeholder groups who provide services and programs to benefit the health and vitality of Downtown Santa Monica and all those who live, work or play here.", "Creation of the DCP", "The path that the DCP has taken to get to this final phase began with the adoption of the LUCE in 2010. The LUCE set forth goals and policies for an expanded Downtown and called for a Specific Plan (the DCP) to propose strategies and standards to create the conditions for a sustainable urban lifestyle. This vision included expanding cultural arts offerings, and adding both intimate and larger open spaces to the growing residential community. The vision addressed traffic, congestion and pedestrian safety by suggesting upgrades to streetscapes, optimizing the circulation network and integrating the Expo Light Rail into the physical fabric of the community in order meet the needs of all people navigating the Downtown. Priority was assigned to public improvements that would enhance the pedestrian experience and to standards and programs that would foster trip reduction by encouraging transit, walking, and biking as well as Transportation Demand Management (TDM) measures.", "The planning effort has been guided by substantial community participation and the involvement of the City\u2019s Boards and Commissions, including the City Council. Throughout the workshops and discussions, public hearings and events, stakeholders have worked assiduously to shape the DCP into a balanced framework that supports residents, business owners, employees, non-profits, property owners and other community stakeholders.

These include public workshops, focus groups, presentations to neighborhood organizations, online surveys, a dedicated interactive project website www.downtownsmplan.org and a variety of fun events such as walking tours, farmer\u2019s market exhibitions and community celebrations for major milestones. Below is a list of meetings and events that have been conducted with the participation of several thousand people.", "MEETINGS CONDUCTED ON THE DCP", "Discussion", "The Final Downtown Community Plan (Attachment A) presents a vision for Downtown Santa Monica that includes a prioritization for over 2,500 new housing units, as well as new public spaces, a further diversification of art and cultural offerings, a prominent role for historic preservation, and a multi-faceted approach to enhancing Downtown\u2019s pedestrian environment through building setbacks and improved streetscapes, to name but a few. Designed to be a relatively lower-scale 5-7 story Downtown, the DCP envisions that change will happen incrementally and be accompanied by infrastructure investments, including enhancements to the mobility network, that support the needs of a growing population.", "Refining the LUCE Vision", "The 2010 LUCE defined newly expanded boundaries for Downtown. The LUCE brought in all areas west of Lincoln Boulevard into the planning boundary to increase Downtown\u2019s footprint and to concentrate desired housing, jobs and community-serving uses near the terminus of the Expo light rail. Noting the inherent challenges faced by Downtown to maintain Santa Monica\u2019s small-town vibrancy and flavor, the LUCE directed the City and community to develop a Specific Plan \u201cto determine the appropriate range of building heights in the district and address the need for open space, affordable and workforce housing, pedestrian access from areas south of the Downtown core, the linkages from Downtown to the Beach and the incorporation of the Downtown Light Rail Station into the fabric of the Downtown. (LUCE Policy D14.1)\u201d", "After six years of Plan development, outreach and public discussions, the DCP has struck a balance to meet the challenges identified in the LUCE. The DCP creates the conditions for a lively pedestrian-oriented mix of uses and activities, including new housing options that are complemented by services and public spaces to create a complete neighborhood. It further strengthens Downtown\u2019s identity by safeguarding City designated historic resources and potential historic resources through a comprehensive preservation approach, and marries this to the creation of \u201cnew landmarks\u201d that will spring from flexible development standards that inspire creativity and innovation at a scale that is consistent with Santa Monica\u2019s contemporary urban form. Lastly, the DCP continues to rely on the concept that pedestrians come first in Downtown Santa Monica. Addressing the full range of mobility in the Downtown relies on building on the investments already in place and strategic investment in infrastructure and programs to the meet the transportation needs of Downtown.", "As a comprehensive document, the DCP provides substantial policy guidance on all of the elements mentioned above, such that the Council and its Boards and Commissions will have a framework for making decisions about public investments, or judging the merit of proposals that are submitted by private individuals who wish to effect any manner of change Downtown. Significantly, the DCP also provides a suite of actions that the City itself will use to develop departmental and interagency workplans around infrastructure upgrades, public space enhancement, economic development, historic preservation, and mobility. These actions, implemented in coordination with a monitoring program that includes a cap on the volume of development evaluated under the Plan\u2019s EIR, will guide city leaders to carefully steward the evolution of Downtown in a manner that is consistent with the long-term goals of the community for sustainability, resilience and well-being.", "This report summarizes the core components of the Downtown Community Plan and provides information on the substantive outreach process, as well as input from the Planning Commission and other Boards and Commission that have weighed-in on the final draft. For clarity, the report is organized into the following three chapters:", "1. THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN", "2. PLAN DEVELOPMENT AND FEEDBACK", "3. COUNCIL CONSIDERATIONS", "CHAPTER 1: THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN", "A. Urban Design and Land Use Strategy", "For the past century, Downtown Santa Monica\u2019s built environment has responded to various eras of change. From its infancy as a crossroads of commerce and civic life, to its present day role as bustling local hangout and job/tourist center Downtown\u2019s buildings stand as a record of human endeavor, and as a reflection of the zoning standards that each subsequent generation implemented to guide the urban form priorities of the day. This incremental approach is responsible for the great diversity of building heights Downtown, which range from one-story brick and mortar structures to taller twenty-one-story glass and steel buildings.", "The DCP acknowledges the interplay between the old and new as a necessary ingredient to Downtown\u2019s authenticity, and presents an urban design strategy to safeguard the identifiable historic core within the Bayside Conservation District, and transfer unused development potential to the areas immediately served by the Expo Light Rail. The 5-7 story height profile proposed by the DCP is framed by 4-story transition zones that gradually reduce height and scale at Downtown\u2019s outer edges where it abuts the residential neighborhoods of Wilmont and Mid-City, and where views of the Pacific Ocean open up on Ocean Avenue.", "The development standards for the Plan\u2019s six land use districts (Bayside Conservation, Neighborhood Village, Transit Adjacent, Lincoln Transition, Wilshire Transition, Ocean Transition) derive from the urban design strategy and provide equilibrium between the community\u2019s desire to protect the historic scale of Downtown\u2019s central walking area centered on the Third Street Promenade with the need to accommodate additional residential and commercial activities in areas that are regionally connected by transit.", "Downtown Land Use Districts", "Land Use", "Downtown\u2019s vibrancy is attributed to its unique mix of shops, restaurants, offices, institutions, health and well-being centers, entertainment venues, markets, apartments, and dozens of other offerings that are used daily by locals, employees and visitors. As the expanded boundaries of Downtown begin to transition into a mixed-use environment, the DCP provides a logical structure for regulating land uses in a way that is complimentary to the urban design strategy by directing the most intensive pedestrian-oriented uses to the historic core and transit area, and limiting the presence of larger more regionally-sized commercial uses adjacent to residential areas.", "This framework supports the DCP\u2019s Land Use Regulations, which are finely-tuned to balance the Downtown\u2019s various roles as urban neighborhood, regional job center and visitor destination.", "Urban Form and Building Design", "Santa Monica is renowned as a center of innovation and creativity, often leading the region - if not the nation \u2013 on issues of sustainability, community enrichment and urban policy. These practices are woven throughout many adopted City documents, such as the Zoning Ordinance, that influence building design both in our commercial areas as well as in our residential neighborhoods.", "In Downtown, the City has the opportunity to embody these principles in a new urban typology that celebrates architectural expression through flexible design standards. The DCP departs from the rigid formulas of the past several decades that have produced \u201cwedding cake\u201d buildings, and instead employs a suite of percentage-based modulation requirements that allow for an architectural concept to drive building design. These standards, which ensure a consistent pedestrian-scaled streetwall, interior access to light and air, and communal open spaces for building residents, provide designers with a comfortable canvas for exemplary architecture while empowering planners and reviewing bodies with sufficient criteria to evaluate the merit of individual projects. In response to comments received from the design community during the Planning Commission\u2019s deliberations on the draft DCP, avenues for alternative compliance or modifications to standards along with strategic exemptions from standards for single lot projects were added to the Planning Commission\u2019s recommended changes.", "The Architectural Review Board (ARB) discussed the Downtown Community Plan at both their June 5, 2017 and June 19, 2017 meetings and generally endorsed the urban design strategy and urban form approach. There was a robust exchange of ideas including discussion of design standards, modulation standards and design guidelines, the Bayside Conservation District and attention to potential historic resources and Landmark properties, open space provisions, as well as other aspects of the plan. The ARB Subcommittee also made many specific recommendations, identifying conflicts within the plan that needed clarification, and highlighting technical architectural items to be addressed with greater precision. These items have been addressed in the staff-recommended Addenda (Attachment C).", "The ARB is generally supportive of the Downtown Community plan presented. The ARB had a particular interest and concern regarding the modulation standards and were focused on ensuring the adopted standards do not prevent or hinder innovation and/or excellence in design. To that end, the ARB would like to support the following implementation actions:", "\u00b7 Add to Chapter 6, Implementation Actions a report on whether the development standards have resulted in desired outcomes. The change is recommended on Page 249, Item 5A, Enforcement of Project Entitlements, \u201cReview the design quality of downtown project to ensure diverse design typologies, innovation and quality design.\u201d", "\u00b7 The Board strongly endorses the use of resources such as the Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Ambassador Program and outreach to private property owners regarding possible management partnerships to ensure successful outdoor spaces are incorporated into existing and new projects.", "\u00b7 The Board also endorses the action to develop a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District (NCOD) in the Bayside Conservation District (BSCD).", "Staff has added the ARB\u2019s proposed implementation action to the staff-recommended Addenda. Since the June ARB meetings, the Board\u2019s DCP subcommittee submitted a recommendation to add a special alternative stepback option for all Districts. The proposal would allow \u201cforms, geometries, and skins such as layered facades and brise-soleils that do not fit the modulation standards but generally conform to the intent for three-dimensional design and to ensure light and air into buildings and down to the street to be considered on a case-by-case basis through discretionary review.\u201d To this point, staff notes that the Plan already allows for architectural projections beyond the building frontage line for 2/3 of the fa\u00e7ade and therefore, believes the forms and geometries contemplated by the ARB subcommittee would be accommodated within the Plan\u2019s allowable projections.", "Key Concepts", "The Downtown Community Plan is a Housing Plan", "The Downtown Community Plan\u2019s primary responsibility is to respond to the direction of the LUCE to encourage the growth of the residential population Downtown. This strategic land use emphasis is intended to accommodate the unmet demand for new housing in Santa Monica by directing the production of over 2,500 new units to an area that is rich with public transportation options and where higher densities can support a more sustainable development pattern. The primacy of housing development is highlighted in the DCP by policy and Plan standards that provide incentives to encourage the production of new housing units, both market-rate and affordable to people of lower incomes. The Housing Commission supports the DCP\u2019s approach to housing production.", "Housing Incentives", "\u00b7 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: housing projects have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus over commercial projects of a similar size.", "\u00b7 Height Bonus on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevards: housing projects on Lincoln and Wilshire Boulevard may achieve the maximum permitted height of the districts, whereas commercial projects are subject to a 10-foot reduction from the maximum permitted height.", "\u00b7 PC RECOMMENDED: Process Incentives: entitlements for housing projects enjoy higher development review thresholds than their commercial counterparts.", "o Housing projects up to 60,000 square feet (on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet) throughout the Downtown shall be processed through an Administrative Approval.", "o Tier 3 housing projects up to 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District shall be processed through a Development Review Permit.", "Affordable Housing Requirements", "In addition to the housing incentives that are provided in the DCP\u2019s Standards and Regulations, affordable housing production will be stimulated by new requirements for Tier 2 and non-negotiated Tier 3 projects. These requirements were determined based upon feasibility analyses prepared by HR&A (Attachment I).", "\u00b7 Uniform Affordable Housing Requirement by Height: the DCP proposes a modified framework for affordable housing, compared to existing regulations, that requires a single percentage of on-site or off-site housing, depending on the proposed height of the project.", "\u00b7 Increased On-site Affordable Housing Requirements: the DCP requires a greater percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than currently required.", "\u00b7 Augmented Off-Site Affordable Housing Requirements: projects that wish to satisfy their Affordable Housing requirement off-site of the market-rate project will be subject to an even higher percentage of deed-restricted affordable units than the on-site equivalent. Based on the Planning Commission\u2019s review of the DCP Affordable Housing proposal, the distance that an off-site project can be located from its related market-rate project has been expanded to anywhere within the Downtown, or within one-quarter mile of the market rate project.", "\u00b7 Mandated Affordable Income Level Mix: based upon the proportionate household income levels in the Housing Element Regional Housing Needs Assessment and requirements of Proposition R, the revised DCP includes a new requirement to provide a mix of income levels within the total affordable units required for the project so that each project provides units affordable to extremely low, very low, low and moderate incomes.", "Exemptions for 100% Affordable Housing Projects", "\u00b7 PC RECOMMENDED: Administrative Approval Threshold: 100% Affordable Housing projects up to 75 units may be approved administratively.", "\u00b7 PC RECOMMENDED: Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Bonus: 100% Affordable housing projects in the Neighborhood Village have access to an additional 0.5 FAR bonus and 10 feet of additional height.", "The DCP projects an estimated minimum of 2,500 new units produced over the next 15-20 years, which represents a doubling of the residential population that emerged over the past three decades. Most of the new housing projects will include a healthy mix of unit sizes and affordability levels based on the DCP\u2019s policy direction and project requirements. It is important to note that 2,500 new units is a projection, not an absolute number, and could be increased upwards due to market forces that favor housing production over other land uses, such as commercial office or retail.", "The DCP\u2019s housing strategy and project requirements were reviewed by the Housing Commission at meetings on June 15, 2017 and June 20, 2017. The Housing Commission endorses most aspects of the DCP\u2019s housing approach including incentives for 100% affordable housing projects. However, the Housing Commission recommends that additional project or process requirements be contemplated further. Many of these recommendations include changes to proposed measures in the Plan including", "\u00b7 Eliminating CUP requirement for SRO projects", "\u00b7 Rejecting the process incentives for housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission", "\u00b7 Prohibiting any offsite affordable housing within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway", "\u00b7 Ensuring that the Housing Element Quantified Objective and Proposition R production requirements have been met before middle-income units (130%-180% AMI as indicated in DCP) could be considered in development agreement negotiations", "The inclusion of SRO projects as a permitted use is a change that will be reflected in the use table. The streamlined process for typical housing projects recommended by the Planning Commission was based on the need to create a clear and predictable process for housing projects as compared to commercial projects. To provide context to the location of offsite affordable housing, the Planning Commission discussed the limitation of residential uses within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway but did not impose any locational restrictions. Further, much of the Transit Adjacent district is within 500 feet of the I-10 freeway. Development agreement negotiations are conducted on a case-by-case basis so there would be no obligation to include any middle-income units.", "The Housing Commission also made several recommendations that extend beyond the scope of what has been in the public discourse or in proposals presented by staff or the community, including:", "\u00b7 A graduated affordable housing requirement that escalates up to 35% based on allowable height and FAR thresholds", "\u00b7 Eliminating any office or retail uses above the ground floor for new buildings, with exceptions for areas that the Council deems appropriate.", "\u00b7 Applying project requirements (i.e. affordability mix and average bedroom factor) to offsite 100% affordable housing projects with an exemption from the requirements only if necessary to obtain other forms of public financing", "\u00b7 Biennial review of DCP Affordable Housing and AHPP requirements to determine if new incentives or requirements should be instituted", "\u00b7 Encouraging ground floor residential units to have a preference for low-income disabled persons and artists, subject to City Attorney review regarding any fair housing implications", "\u00b7 Reviewing the entire AHPP now for consistency with Prop R income targeting and rent limits and revise the affordability requirements outside of Downtown based upon new feasibility studies similar to that conducted for the DCP", "\u00b7 Increasing deed-restriction terms on affordable units from 55 years to the life of the project", "\u00b7 Identifying publically-owned land as a potential resource to achieve affordable housing goals", "Staff appreciates the thoughtful detail that the Housing Commission put into their recommendations, some of which fall outside of the regulatory framework of the DCP in terms of deed restriction term limits and the framework of the AHPP.", "Staff defers to Council on the subject of modified affordable housing requirements, but notes that a careful balance has been struck within the DCP between project requirements, fees, and process. Any recommendation must also be supported by the HR&A feasibility analysis. The elimination of office or retail space above the ground floor may appear attractive as a means to create housing projects but prohibiting office and retail above the ground floor must be carefully considered in balance with other uses that are vital to the City\u2019s economy, social services network, or other important land uses that create a complete community.", "The draft DCP proposes that offsite affordable housing projects must be owned in whole or part and operated by a non-profit housing provider. It is likely that these providers will seek public financing that will dictate the affordability requirements of the project, which is why the DCP exempts 100% affordable housing projects from the project requirements for Tier 2 and Tier 3 projects. However, there may be an instance where an offsite affordable housing project is completely privately financed. In this case, the project would still be required to comply with the definition of a 100% affordable housing project per Section 9.52.020.0050 of the Zoning Ordinance (25% of units affordable to 60% income households with remainder affordable to 80% income households). From a policy perspective, the net result is more affordable housing units and therefore, flexibility should be provided in how the offsite affordable housing is achieved. With respect to preference for artists, a new policy has also been included to explore accommodating artists within ground floor residential units provided the classifications do not result in unintended discriminatory impacts.", "The DCP includes a monitoring requirement that would produce a report concurrent with the LUCE monitoring. The monitoring report would include data presented as part of the Proposition R annual reports. Staff does not support a requirement that the DCP affordable housing requirements be reviewed every two years as there may not be sufficient data points to inform such a study.", "The Preservation of Existing Buildings is Strongly Supported", "Preserving the historic scale and character of Downtown\u2019s beloved walking areas is a central objective of the DCP\u2019s change strategy, which seeks to carefully retain many older structures that evoke nostalgia for Santa Monica\u2019s colorful past. The DCP improves upon previous historic preservation policies, and provides substantial support for adaptive reuse. A six-step approach outlines a variety of economic and technical incentives.", "Adaptive Reuse Incentives", "Exemptions from standard development requirements have been added to the DCP that create economic and technical incentives for owners of properties identified as City Designated Historic Resources or as potential historic resources. Several examples include exemptions from development standards, such as parking, open space, and certain use regulations that would create barriers to adaptive reuse. It should be noted that other technical incentives are available such as the California Historical Building Code, which recognizes older buildings often need alternative methods in meeting fire and life safety requirements.", "Protections for Historic Resources", "A new protection included in the DCP is an action to submit the Downtown Historic Resource Inventory (HRI) to the State Office of Historic Preservation, which would mean that all HRI-listed properties are considered presumptive historic resources under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires that exterior alterations to historic resources comply with the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. If alterations are not in conformance or demolition is proposed, more detailed environmental review of the proposed project would be required, possibly including an Environmental Impact Report.", "Several new process changes are also included in the DCP to facilitate the conservation of City Designated Historic Resources and potential historic resources Downtown. These include modified demolition screening procedures that require Landmarks Commission review of demolition permits for structures more than 40 years old and clearance of the required 75-day waiting period before any Planning application can be submitted. This new procedure would serve as a means to identify potential historic resources prior to the submittal of an application, which would be complemented with an associated amendment to SMMC Article 8 (Building Regulations) to increase the lifespan for demolition applications. Future actions to support this process change include updating the Landmarks Ordinance to provide alternative pathways to designation and the creation of a Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District within the Bayside Conservation District to identify design features that provide visual identity to 2nd and 4th Streets. Special standards for the Bayside Conservation District include eliminating the open space requirements and relaxed modulation requirements in order to clearly define the traditional streetwall of 2nd and 4th Streets.", "The Landmarks Commission reviewed the DCP\u2019s approach to Historic Preservation at their June 12, 2017 meeting and supports the approach subject to the following recommended changes:", "\u00b7 Specify possible funding sources for historic preservation", "\u00b7 Assure that the existing provisions in the Municipal Code for expediting plan check occur in practice", "\u00b7 Increase outreach and public education regarding historic preservation", "\u00b7 Amend Policy HP2.4 to read, \u201cAdaptive reuse of older building should be considered for new construction and rehabilitation projects, when the scale, materials or method of construction evokes Downtown\u2019s history, and where the fa\u00e7ade building contributes to a continuous streetscape.\u201d", "Staff supports the Landmarks Commission\u2019s recommendations and has added relevant changes to the recommended Addenda. Going forward, staff will continue to look for opportunities to realize existing incentives for historic preservation, and to help expand outreach on this subject.", "New Public and Open Spaces are Prioritized throughout Downtown", "Because Downtown was largely developed as a commercial district it contains very few dedicated public spaces where groups can congregate. While many of the existing parks or public spaces that are utilized by Downtown residents and visitors are located nearby in other districts (e.g. Tongva Park, Palisades Park, Reed Park); within Downtown, only the public right of way, and places like the Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Place, and the Santa Monica Main Library serve as Downtown\u2019s dedicated public open space offerings. Recognizing this, the community overwhelmingly identified the maintenance, enhancement or creation of public space as the #1 priority for Downtown\u2019s evolution.", "The DCP looks at the public space network comprehensively, and acknowledges that a nuanced approach that involves both City and private interests must be considered. To this end, the Plan emphasizes the role that private development must play to add new public spaces to Downtown. The DCP identifies key sites where development has been proposed and where negotiations with property owners may yield significant public open space. Similarly, the Public Space plan includes existing publically-accessible spaces (\u201cPOPs\u201d) that should be redesigned to promote better access and programming, perhaps incentivized with a small modicum of new floor area. Management and oversight of these spaces is paramount, and will require the involvement of City staff, DTSM and private property owners.", "Based on outreach, smaller scale public spaces such as pocket parks, courtyards and plazas are preferred over larger open spaces such as a central park or recreation fields. Additionally, the quality of Downtown\u2019s streetscapes is to be improved to emphasize their role as public spaces and the opportunity they provide to further pedestrianize the area through wider sidewalks, a larger more verdant urban forest, and street furnishings that would make the walking experience more enjoyable.", "Private Open Space in Housing Projects", "A new feature of the DCP\u2019s zoning standards is the requirement for typical housing projects to provide on-site open space for residents\u2019 use. Depending on the size of the project area, a project is required to dedicate 20-25% of the total lot area to courtyards, rooftop gardens, balconies and other open space types, and of this percentage one-quarter must be designed for communal use. Single-lot projects are exempt from these standards.", "The Recreation and Parks Commission (RPC) reviewed the DCP\u2019s Public Space approach at their December 15, 2016 meeting and subsequently provided a letter expressing unanimous support for the various approaches and policies surrounding the creation or enhancement of public open spaces Downtown. The RPC conditioned their support on several recommendations, including:", "\u00b7 That the DCP maximize every opportunity to create open space, including true green space, courtyards, plazas and paseos;", "\u00b7 That the DCP identify parcels that would be suitable for acquisition for open space use;", "\u00b7 That the DCP include policies reflecting the need to work with private property owners to activate empty plazas;", "\u00b7 That ground floor open space be included in all residential projects;", "\u00b7 That projects subject to DAs provide substantial open space benefits and that property owners should be held accountable for maintaining open space amenities to the highest levels.", "Nearly all of the RPC\u2019s recommendations have been addressed and incorporated into the final draft DCP. The one exception is the recommendation to require ground floor open space, which was not integrated into the final plan as it would conflict with the broader urban design strategy to maintain a consistent streetwall at the ground floor.", "Encouraging Economic Vitality is Important to Downtown\u2019s Future", "Downtown is a major employment center (approx. 25,000 jobs) and a revenue generator that supports the many programs, services and activities that residents citywide have come to enjoy. While constituting only 4.5% of the City, Downtown\u2019s generates over a third of the total sales tax revenues for Santa Monica, and another third of all hotel room revenues citywide. Additionally, fees collected from development to fund park maintenance, childcare programs, urban runoff projects, and transportation enhancements are largely drawn from projects located in Downtown. The combination of these elements has helped Downtown, and the city as a whole, weather challenging financial crises such as the Great Recession.", "Given its prominence as Silicon Beach and a major tourist destination, one of Downtown\u2019s inherent tensions is the degree to which it caters to locals, employees and visitors alike. The challenge ahead is to ensure that it remains a place for everyone, and that opportunities for economic diversity are embraced. The DCP weaves together policies and standards that create a \u201clocal business-friendly\u201d environment that can provide space for a broad mix of job opportunities in new and expanding industries whether they be creative office and co-working spaces, retail, dining and entertainment, or hospitality. The Promenade is further supported through a variety of exemptions from design standards to allow for greater flexibility, and through a change to several regulations that currently restrict uses. Going forward, an Action of the DCP is to work with Public Works and DTSM, Inc. on a Promenade improvement project to enhance its infrastructure, lighting and right-of-way features.", "In the course of outreach, a clear preference emerged to support the creative economy, and to expand opportunities for local entrepreneurialism with small and medium-sized businesses. To this end, the draft DCP includes a variety of changes from the zoning ordinance that are intended to reduce regulatory barriers for small businesses and typical changes of use. These include relaxed parking standards and less restrictive use regulations that ensure ground floor uses reflect the appropriate level of activity based on adjacency to residential uses.", "The Downtown Santa Monica Inc. Board of Directors (DTSM) conducted a comprehensive review of the draft DCP and while there is agreement on many of the key approaches, there remains concern regarding the distribution of heights and densities across Downtown and the effect on housing production. DTSM highlighted six key recommendations for the Council\u2019s consideration:", "\u00b7 Increase height and FAR in the BC and NV districts to 84 feet and FAR of 4.0 and to 60 feet and FAR of 2.75 for both sides of the Lincoln Transition district.", "\u00b7 Provide streamlined process for granting flexibility from all aspects of retail space design and configuration standards to respond to the shifting retail environment.", "\u00b7 Include a clear vision for a new state-of-the-art movie theater on the site of either Parking Structure #1 or #3.", "\u00b7 Support for allowing ground floor office in midblock locations in the Neighborhood Village district as demand may not be sufficient to support retail in these locations resulting in vacancies detrimental to the neighborhood.", "\u00b7 Include a clear statement on improvements to vehicle circulation with inclusion of a Vehicle Action Plan, similar in scope to Bike and Pedestrian Action Plans.", "\u00b7 Consider flexibility in desired widths for sidewalk zones in order to accommodate space for outdoor dining.", "As discussed later in the report highlighting issues for Council consideration, policy options are presented to address housing production and ground floor office in Neighborhood Village midblock locations. The proposed heights and FARs in the Plan have been carefully crafted within the context of the urban design strategy to place the highest intensities closest to the Expo Station and to balance new development with the existing character of Downtown.", "DTSM\u2019s recommendations on a modification process for retail configuration are already included in the draft Plan. Language regarding support for movie theaters is also included in the Addenda. The sidewalk widths in the Plan are provided as conceptual illustrations and will be more comprehensively reviewed as part of the follow-up action to create a Downtown Streetscape Manual for how the public right-of-way is used and managed. As discussed in the following section, the Plan proposes a comprehensive Mobility approach that addresses improvements for all modes.", "A New Model for Mobility: Improving Today, Preparing for the Future", "A new model for mobility includes making more transportation options attractive, convenient, affordable, and safer so that people feel they can circulate without driving alone. It is an evolution of how people get to Downtown, and how they experience traveling within Downtown. The creation of parking structures may have revived Downtown, Expo service has provided a new transit option, while the future is expected to include travel by driverless vehicles.", "The \u2018park once, pedestrians first\u2019 mantra has been a guiding tenet for the past 30 years in Downtown. Recently Expo light rail service, pedestrian scramble intersections, a bike center, bicycle lanes and bike share have been introduced to Downtown. The next phase will likely see more changes related to car service (Lyft, Uber, taxi), increasing demand for curb space, and technology. Success of the area is tied to the success of the pedestrian environment \u2013 continuing to be a place that residents and visitors both want to walk from place to place.", "Transportation in Downtown is as diverse as the people who travel there. Downtown is a place that welcomes the service workers who make it function, as much as resident visitors and tourists \u2013 who may take a bus, ride the train, drive with friends, or take a tour bus. People come in buses, carpools, on foot and by bike and walk throughout the district. Providing a quality transportation experience requires flexibility to make it more effective for all of these roadway users. This includes measuring our performance in making streets serve people first, and prioritizing modes that are more efficient.", "A new focus in the DCP is the quickly-evolving technology influence on transportation, including electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and transit service provided by private organizations. Since the inception of the development of this plan, car services, have gained widespread acceptance. The City\u2019s response must be internal, by shaping choices so that the convenient option also meets community values, and external, by actively participating in the field of changing technology. The plan includes recommendations to work with businesses to provide micro-transit, to use technology to provide on-demand transit service, to focus on community priorities such as equitable access to autonomous vehicles, and to participate in regional transportation technology efforts. A new model for mobility requires changes to policies, new investments, different requirements for property owners, adapting business practices, and partnership with the Santa Monica community.", "Art and Cultural Offerings Create New Opportunities Downtown", "The demand for new and more diverse art, cultural and entertainment activities is increasing Downtown. To establish Downtown\u2019s identity as a major cultural center, the City must carefully consider new opportunities for cultural engagement to stretch Downtown\u2019s vibrancy. Building from the traditionally retail-centered economic base, events, major artworks, unique creative expressions and live music will infuse the street and public spaces to strengthen Santa Monica\u2019s as a cultural destination. Additional entertainment choices Downtown, particularly nighttime venues, will provide residents, employees and visitors with a wider array of destination experiences than in the past, such as live performance spaces for theater and live music. The Arts Commission supports the DCP\u2019s approach to Art and Culture.", "The DCP\u2019s land use regulations now permit a larger range of art and cultural uses than historically permitted in the past. The Plan includes an invitation to potential museum operators to work with the City to locate a museum Downtown, and identifies several locations where major works of public art could be located.", "At its November 21, 2016 meeting the Arts Commission enthusiastically supported the inclusion of arts and culture into the DCP, and offered the several recommendations, which have largely been incorporated into the final Plan:", "\u00b7 Encourage policies and public/private partnerships that promote robust artistic activities throughout downtown, in businesses, open spaces and vacant storefronts.", "\u00b7 Support Creative Placemaking efforts that enhance other city goals, such as mobility and activating open spaces.", "\u00b7 Wherever possible, the DCP should ease restrictions and streamline procedures to facilitate pop-up art interventions in underutilized spaces.", "\u00b7 Encourage the development of public and public/private open space, and provide incentives for artists and arts groups to work with City Cultural Affairs staff to develop and implement art and Creative Placemaking programs downtown.", "\u00b7 Position Downtown Santa Monica as a cultural destination", "\u00b7 Expand options for live music and the performing arts in downtown facilities and businesses.", "\u00b7 Of the affordable housing that is produced Downtown, 10% of the units should be designed and set aside for artist housing or live/work units.", "The DCP directly addresses all of the recommendations of the Arts Commission through its policy framework and subsequent implementation actions with the exception of the Arts Commission\u2019s recent request that artist housing or live/work units be included as part of the DCP\u2019s affordable housing requirements. Additional refinements have been recorded in the recommended Addenda that reflect specific direction on certain actions.", "Community Wellbeing", "The City\u2019s Wellbeing Project looks beyond traditional performance measures or economic indicators and uses a new method to gain an understanding of how all of these factors interact and affect residents\u2019 quality of life. The core of the project is the Wellbeing Index, which provides the City with a snapshot of its current wellbeing strengths and needs by analyzing data collected from residents, city departments and social media to gain a robust understanding of how the people of Santa Monica are doing across multiple measures known to influence wellbeing.", "The Wellbeing Index demonstrates that Downtown residents benefit from many positive dimensions, such as access to healthy food, proximity to culturally enriching experiences and institutions, use and enjoyment of Downtown\u2019s outdoor spaces, and frequent use of the many mobility options provided. However, the Index also points to areas of concern that highlight the growing pains of a residential neighborhood in its infancy. The metrics for stress, stability and life/work balance all register slightly higher Downtown than any other neighborhood in the city. One indicator of particular concern to the planning team reveals that Downtown residents do not feel connected to one another in the way that fosters community, trust among neighbors, and social interaction. Tying the results of the Index to Plan policies and standards strengthens the logic for prioritizing affordable housing, public open space, new neighborhood serving uses, youth and senior services, and many others.", "The Social Services Commission submitted their recommendations to the Planning Commission on April 26, 2017. Specifically, the Social Services Commission recommended the use of the Wellbeing Project data to guide development agreement negotiations and be used as a tool to advance a diverse and multigenerational Downtown community, support for affordable housing, and specificity for policies supporting wraparound community and social services to serve the Downtown community. Recommendations that development projects include setasides for affordable/low-cost office space and community rooms could not be included due to lack of nexus between such requirements and new development; however, such amenities could be included in negotiated projects. Many of the Social Services Commission\u2019s recommendations were included in the Planning Commission\u2019s final recommendation on the DCP.", "B. IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING THE PLAN", "Implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility. Chapter 6 outlines all actions in the Plan along with a relative estimate of cost, responsibility, timing, and potential funding sources (Table 6.1 of the draft Plan). This can used as a budgeting tool and also as a means to support grant applications. Table 6.1 demonstrates that implementation of the DCP will be a shared responsibility dependent on not only City leadership but also coordination with community partnerships and cooperation from private entities.", "The DCP monitoring report will be prepared concurrent with the LUCE 5-year Measuring and Monitoring Report. One key area that will be monitored is the development cap of 3.2M square feet of net new floor area in Downtown. This development cap represents the amount of new development that could occur that would still allow achievement of the LUCE goal of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips. Any project proposal that exceeds the cap would not be able to be approved until additional environmental analysis and amendments have been completed. There are also other indicators to monitor the performance of the DCP listed on Page 247-249 of the draft Plan.", "CHAPTER 2: PLAN DEVELOPMENT", "A. COMMUNITY OUTREACH", "Many years of outreach have marked the development of the DCP. Interdepartmental staff and the planning team have worked with community stakeholders and the City\u2019s Boards and Commissions to tackle challenging issues in search of consensus, and have listened intently to the perspectives brought forward by the many voices involved in shaping the Plan.", "Beginning in 2012, outreach on the DCP has taken on many forms, from workshops on Emerging Themes, Community Benefits, and Urban form, to stakeholder interviews and meetings with the Planning Commission and City Council. In total, seven workshops were held to drill into Plan concepts and generate feedback from the community. At the onset of 2016, staff re-engaged the community on a variety of topics to move closer towards consensus and to refine the Plan.", "2016 Outreach and Engagement", "Beginning shortly after the Planning Commission\u2019s March 2nd, 2016 meeting, staff launched an unprecedented outreach campaign to community groups and local organizations, employing the City\u2019s Office of Communications as a partner in diversifying the input opportunities and in reaching new voices within the community. The outreach tools and platforms used to engage thousands of people were expansive and yielded greater detail about the community\u2019s preference for things like open space, art and culture, mobility, jobs and housing and historic preservation. Importantly, the outreach also demonstrated that there are a great many perspectives on height, development and planning for large sites that have the ability to support much desired amenities.", "A detailed breakdown of the 2016 outreach and supporting documentation is provided in the November 16, 2016 Planning Commission staff report. Below is a snapshot of last year\u2019s outreach by the numbers:", "\u00b7 1,200 people provided feedback on Downtown priorities in workshops, focus groups and online", "\u00b7 Over 40 community presentations were given to local groups and organizations in both English and Spanish", "\u00b7 7 community conversation focus groups were held at the Main Public Library and at Senior Residences Downtown", "\u00b7 3 public workshops were held on the subjects of Placemaking, Preservation and Change and Mobility", "\u00b7 3 Downtown walking tours were co-hosted by the planning team and the Santa Monica Conservancy", "\u00b7 4.6 million social media impressions were recorded on facebook, twitter and instagram", "\u00b7 8,700 unique visits to the DCP website, www.downtownsmplan.org", "Leading up to the release of the 2017 Final Draft Downtown Community Plan, staff held several events to provide a broad overview into the content of the Plan and to establish a rapport with interested community members who sought clarifications on key subjects or who had questions about the collective vision for Downtown\u2019s future.", "B. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS", "In accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared that analyzed the potential environmental effects associated with the DCP. The Draft Program EIR was circulated for a 90 day public review period beginning on February 3, 2016 (exceeding the minimum 45-day public review as required by Section 15067 of the CEQA Guidelines). In addition, a Recirculated Draft EIR was circulated for a 45-day public review period in February 2017 to reflect changes that were made to the draft DCP.", "Comments on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR included public concerns about development in Downtown, the Miramar established large site, height, traffic, aesthetics, and neighborhood character. The Final EIR provides written responses to all comments received on the Draft EIR and Recirculated Draft EIR. Some minor text changes and clarification were also included in the Final EIR.", "The Final EIR analyzes the effect of potential land use changes that could occur in the Downtown through 2030 as a result of the implementation of the DCP, including review of the range of impacts between two different buildout scenarios. Scenario A (High Scenario) would entail higher FARs for sites in the Downtown with variation by district, and represents the City Council\u2019s outside parameters for EIR analysis established during the August 13, 2013 meeting, which includes FARs up to 5.0 for the established large sites. Scenario B has a lower range of FARs, with up to 4.0 FAR for the established large sites. Scenario B represents a maximum cap of 3.22 million sf of net new floor area in the Downtown.", "The Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts for air quality, construction effects, construction noise, cultural resources, and traffic. Specifically because the details of specific future projects occurring in the Downtown are unknown, the Final EIR concludes that construction-related air emissions and noise (vibration) would be significant and unavoidable. Furthermore, although the DCP would establish greater preservation policies and standards, the Final EIR concludes that historic impacts would be significant and unavoidable since individual projects could involve the demolition or alteration of a historic resource. Additionally, due to the City\u2019s stringent thresholds for traffic and the existing levels of traffic in Downtown, the Final EIR identifies significant and unavoidable impacts with respect to traffic (automobile delay). Aesthetic impacts of the DCP, including those due to building height, are considered less than significant pursuant to Section 21099 of the CEQA Statute, which states that aesthetic impacts of residential, mixed use, and employment center projects in transit priority areas are considered less than significant.", "Most importantly, the Final EIR concludes that Scenario B of the DCP (with 3.2 million sf cap) would achieve the goals of No Net New PM Peak Hour Trips by 2030, and would reduce per capita vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions, which is consistent with the intent of SB743 and upcoming changes to CEQA. Additionally, as noted in the Final EIR, the DCP implements the sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction goals and policies established in the City\u2019s LUCE, Sustainable City Plan, Climate Action Plan, and SCAG\u2019s Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The DCP is based on a vision of supporting and enhancing the Downtown as a multi-modal district that is fully integrated with the Downtown Station of the Expo LRT. The DCP also emphasizes new land uses in areas proximate to the Downtown Station to minimize vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled, and associated GHG emissions. Additionally, the Plan would enhance multi-modal relationships, calling for new connections and circulation improvements for all modes as well as aggressive TDM measures such as employer trip reduction plans and subsidized transit passes or transportation allowances for residents and employees. Collectively, the standards, policies, and programs in the DCP would support sustainability and GHG reduction goals established by the State, region, and City.", "As required under CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(a), the Final EIR includes a discussion and evaluation of \"a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly obtain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.\" The EIR provides a robust analysis of the DCP as well the following alternatives. The alternatives analysis provides City decision-makers with a reasonable range of alternatives to consider to reduce or avoid impacts.", "\u00b7 Alternative 1 \u2013 No Project Alternative;", "\u00b7 Alternative 2 \u2013 Reduced Project (Elimination of Tier 3) Alternative;", "\u00b7 Alternative 3 \u2013 4th/5th Streets On-Way Streets Circulation Plan;", "\u00b7 Alternative 4 \u2013 Expanded One-way Streets Circulation Plan; and", "\u00b7 Alternative 5 \u2013 Hotel/Tourism-focused Land Use Mix Alternative.", "CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6 requires that an EIR identify the Environmentally Superior Alternative to the proposed project from among the alternatives analyzed. If the No Project Alternative is found to be environmentally superior alternative, the EIR also identifies an Environmentally Superior Alternative from among the other alternatives. For a broad policy document such as the DCP, the potential exists that there may not be a clear Environmentally Superior Alternative. An alternative may have some reduced impact levels and other impacts that are greater than the project, while another alternative reduces different impacts. Although CEQA does not provide specific guidance in this matter, where a project has lower impacts in a majority of resource areas and/or substantially lower impacts in especially critical resource areas, this can support a finding that that alternative is environmentally superior.", "Alternative 2 (Elimination of Tier 3 Projects) would reduce transportation-related impacts on intersections; however, elimination of Tier 3 developments would substantially reduce community benefits and substantial affordable housing and multi-modal transportation investment opportunities within the Downtown, potentially resulting in increased vehicles miles traveled. Therefore, in comparing an incremental reduction in the severity of significant impacts with the achievement of Project goals and objectives, the EIR determined that the implementation of Scenario B of the DCP would be the environmentally superior alternative. Implementation of Scenario B would incrementally reduce potential environmental impacts relative to Scenario A, but implementation of Scenario B would also still achieve all of the goals and objectives of the DCP.", "The Final EIR was presented to Planning Commission for review in April 2017, who recommended certification of the Final EIR. Adoption of the DCP would require Council certification of the Final EIR, and adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and the mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR. Mitigation measures are identified in the Final EIR in the areas of Air Quality, Biological Resources, Construction Effects (Air Quality), Cultural Resources, Hazards/Hazardous Materials, Public Services, Utilities, and Transportation and Circulation. To ensure that these measures are properly enacted, a mitigation monitoring program is necessary and will be enforced during the construction and operation of the project.", "C. PLANNING COMMISSION COMMENTS ON THE PLAN", "During the months of April and May 2017 the Planning Commission held six public hearings to discuss the DCP (April 25, May 10, May 11, May 17, May 18 and May 31) and its Program Environmental Impact Report. These meetings, which spanned over 40 hours of discussion, also provided the opportunity for the community to comment on the Plan\u2019s content, and for staff to clarify concepts. The Commission recommended adoption of the DCP with specific amendments and modifications that are listed in Exhibit B to the adopting resolution (Attachment B). The modifications largely pertain to key development standards and Plan policy that encourage the production of housing, as well as the range and location of land uses that are desired for the area.", "Housing Production", "Among the productive clarifications to design standards, mobility actions, open space creation and well-being targets, the Planning Commission\u2019s most impactful recommendations were to increase several housing-related process thresholds to further stimulate housing production Downtown. Hence, the Commission has recommended that typical mixed-use housing projects up to 60,000 square feet, on lots no greater than 15,000 square feet, be processed ministerially through an Administrative Approval, which would greatly reduce the time necessary to process a development application. In the Transit Adjacent District, the only area in Downtown that has a Tier 3 option, the Commission recommends a Development Review Permit process for housing projects up to 90,000 square feet. This process threshold represents the amount of maximum allowable floor area that could result from a project located on a three-lot site of 22,500 square feet. The Planning Commission\u2019s recommendation was based on overall consensus that this area can support greater densities on account of proximity to the Expo Light Rail.", "Comparison of DCP to Planning Commission recommendations for Housing Project Review Process", "Permit Type", "DCP (April 2017)", "Planning Commission", "Administrative Approval", "Less than 30,000 SF", "Project on lots up to 15,000 SF (typically results in projects less than 60,000 SF)", "Development Review Permit", "All Tier 2 Tier 3 30,000 - 60,000 SF", "Tier 2 on lots over 15,000 SF", "Tier 3 on lots over 15,000 SF and up to 90,000 SF", "Development Agreement", "Tier 3 over 60,000 SF", "Tier 3 over 90,000 SF", "Established Large Site Standards and Process", "Lastly, the Commission spent considerable time discussing the DCP\u2019s options for the Established Large Sites, three sites within Downtown that - given their parcel size - could potentially provide significant community benefits for circulation, open space and cultural facilities that would otherwise not be anticipated from smaller projects. The inclusion of these sites into the Plan sparked the most extensive and spirited debate among Planning Commissioners. There was consideration of various modifications to the staff recommendation. In the end, without majority support for any particular approach to these sites, the Commission narrowly recommended (4-3 straw vote) the removal of the Established Large Site Overlay, which provides unique height and FAR standards for these sites.", "Commissioners who favored including the Established Large Site Overlay sought to establish the DCP as a comprehensive planning tool that creates clear parameters and expectations for projects on the three sites. The Commissioners also supported a transparent and rigorous public review process that requires a development agreement, additional environmental review, and includes special application requirements for the applicant to demonstrate how the project meets the DCP\u2019s objectives. The Commission discussed potentially reducing the maximum height to approximately 100 feet with a setback from Ocean Avenue. These Commissioners expressed concern about reviewing Specific Plan amendments for individual projects soon after adoption of the DCP.", "Commissioners who did not favor including the Established Large Site Overlay supported having the height and FAR standards in Chapter 4, Table 4.2 apply to all Downtown projects. These Commissioners expressed concern that District height limits should not be exceeded and authorizing greater height and FAR in the Plan would signal that increased height is acceptable. There was a desire to ensure that the appropriate form in Downtown is established first through the DCP\u2019s base standards and not influenced by community benefits and project amenities. These Commissioners agreed that applicants for each project should submit Specific Plan Amendments for review on a project-by-project basis.", "Similarly, the Commission rejected a selection of process options that would have required voter approval or a supermajority of Council to effect changes to the adopted DCP. The Commission was nearly unanimous (6-1 straw vote) in the belief that Council authority is sufficient to render decisions related to Plan amendments, and that the referendum process established in State law provides appropriate opportunities for voters to challenge Council\u2019s legislative actions.", "Access and Mobility", "The Planning Commission has actively provided feedback on the Access and Mobility chapter specific actions and overall approach. Following discussion with the Commission, the Plan now calls for preparing for emerging technologies that serves the community\u2019s vision, strengthens the plans consistency with Vision Zero, and updates parking policies that the Commission has since suggested amending. The Commission strongly communicated a desire to not only be forward-thinking but aggressive with implementation, as reflected in the errata sheet recommended by the Commission.", "The DCP addresses steps to ensure how technology can best be used to make Downtown\u2019s existing transportation network work better for people. The Plan includes an approach to making travel information easier to access through real-time information for transit service, bike share availability, travel times, and parking availability. A methodological use of information on parking and travel patterns can also be used to plan for and manage peak travel periods, which allow for having the right amount of people working at the right times to assist travelers and deployment of the most effective changes needed during peak travel periods.", "Technology is increasing the viability of shared rides, microtransit or privately owned transit, autonomous vehicles, and widespread acceptance of electric vehicles. The DCP provides direction on how technology can be integrated with transportation in Downtown and how Santa Monica can participate in guiding the development of these technologies in the region.", "Parking", "Climate change, traffic congestion, and changing usage patterns necessitate shifting parking policies. The Commission has affirmed the right-sizing and right-placing by having a discreet amount of new parking primarily on the periphery of Downtown. There has also been support for studying and then supporting private parking availability for the public.", "Parking related changes suggested to Council by the Planning Commission include:", "\u00b7 Creating a new parking district in the Zoning Ordinance specifically for the Downtown that supports preservation of buildings through greater flexibility when a use changes. The DCP parking requirements recommend a universal parking rate of 1 space per 500 square feet for all retail and restaurant uses under 5,000 square feet, parking rates are similarly adjusted for residential units.

(Action 4.1K)", "CHAPTER 3: COUNCIL CONSIDERATION", "A. SPOTLIGHT ISSUES FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION", "This section of the report identifies several \u201cspotlight\u201d issues for Council consideration that were raised in the course of the Planning Commission\u2019s deliberations on the DCP.", "Housing Production", "The DCP provides for ample housing production over the life of the Plan through a variety of process and technical incentives that are designed to steer development towards the creation of new residential units. These incentives include a .5 FAR bonus for housing projects over their commercial counterparts, as well as some additional height in the transition zones. Coupled with project requirements for new Affordable Housing, the DCP housing production incentives create the condition to achieve the forecasted minimum of 2,500 new units within the next 15 years. The possibility for additional square footage for housing exists within the volume of development contemplated in the Plan\u2019s EIR, potentially adding up to roughly 3,100 new units if less commercial, medical or institutional uses are proposed than originally forecasted.", "Recent criticism of the DCP\u2019s housing approach has raised the specter of the nationwide housing crisis with many proponents demanding higher heights and densities than currently proposed or even studied in the EIR. Public testimony and correspondence point to a sentiment that Santa Monica must do more to provide housing to those in need, even though the City is well on track to achieve or surpass its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) number given by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and that Downtown has the highest allowable FARs in the entire City.", "During the Planning Commission hearings, the Commission recommended several process and technical incentive changes that fast-track housing projects Downtown, such as an Administrative Approval process for typical two-lot projects that typically result in projects of approximately 5-6 stories and 60 units. The Commission also recommended a more permissive administrative threshold for 100% Affordable Housing projects and height and FAR increases for 100% Affordable Housing in the Neighborhood Village District.", "For Council Consideration: Should the Council wish to go beyond the DCP\u2019s recommended \u201chousing-first\u201d strategy, the following options are presented for consideration:", "Option 1: Increase process thresholds by which more housing projects would qualify for streamlined entitlements.", "Option 2: Further reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects (e.g. 10\u2019 and 0.5 FAR).", "Option 3: Require all projects on sites of greater than 15,000 square feet to have at least 50% of the floor area be residential uses, except for hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and the Third Street Promenade.", "Option 4: Increasing the height and FAR standards, subject to additional environmental evaluation", "Table of Supporting and Opposing Arguments for Each Policy Alternative", "Option", "Supporting Argument", "Opposing Argument", "1", "\u00b7 Provides significant time incentives for developers to seek housing", "\u00b7 Creates certainty for community and developer", "\u00b7 Perception of reduction in opportunities for public participation", "2", "\u00b7 Would clearly establish preference for housing projects by further reducing height and FAR for commercial projects", "\u00b7 Overall reduction in height and FAR for commercial projects was done for neighborhood transitions but implementing this strategy in Downtown core could have unintended consequence of affecting Downtown economic vitality", "3", "\u00b7 Guarantees that any larger project would be required to have 50% residential use, prohibiting strictly office and retail projects (exempting hotels, movie theaters, auto dealers, public infrastructure, and buildings on the Third Street Promenade.", "\u00b7 Blanket standard that prescribes land use mix and reduces flexibility in land use decisions", "\u00b7 Proscriptive approach instead of providing incentives", "4", "\u00b7 Could result in potentially more than 2,500 new housing units if FAR standards are increased", "\u00b7 Would not result in substantially more housing units", "\u00b7 Inconsistent with urban design strategy proposed in DCP and widely discussed and endorsed by the community", "Staff Recommendation", "Staff recommends further process incentives be considered as described in Option 1, as they would provide clear project requirements with predictable timelines established in DCP. The Planning Commission recommended that an Administrative Approval process would be appropriate for projects on sites no greater than 15,000 square feet. The Commission also recommended that a Development Review Permit would be appropriate for Tier 3 projects no greater than 90,000 square feet in the Transit Adjacent District. This was intended to allow typical housing projects that are similar in size and scale to housing projects that already exist in the Downtown leaving larger projects subject to Planning Commission review.", "As a further process incentive, Council could establish a higher threshold for Administrative Approvals (AA) that would provide predictability to applicants with respect to number of housing units authorized, amount of affordable housing units required, affordability level of units, open space requirements, and certainty in applicable development standards. The Administrative Approval (AA) process provides certainty that the project will be approved if it meets all of the DCP\u2019s project requirements. This class of housing projects would be required to obtain a recommendation from the ARB before the AA could be approved and would still need to obtain final approval on the project design from the ARB. This process is similar to the procedural incentives that were formerly in place for Downtown in the 1990s that resulted in the production of approximately 2,500 housing units over the course of three decades. The significant difference is the DCP has a variety of development standards in place that are intended to ensure that projects not only complement Downtown\u2019s existing character but also contribute to the implementation of Downtown as a vibrant, walkable place that welcomes a diverse population of all income levels.", "Established Large Sites", "The Planning Commission\u2019s narrow recommendation to remove the Established Large Site Overlay from the DCP points to the divergence of opinions surrounding tall buildings in Downtown Santa Monica.

Those in favor of the Overlay, which would allow three projects to propose building heights up to 130\u2019 within an established planning framework, argued that the potential benefits for open space, historic preservation, and mobility outweighed potential negative impacts associated with shade/shadow and scale. Those opposed to the Overlay expressed concern that Santa Monica\u2019s identity as a low-scale coastal community would be compromised by tall buildings, and further \u2013 that the DCP\u2019s standards should reflect a level playing field for all development, and not single out a few exceptions.", "For Council Consideration: Should the DCP include the Established Large Site Overlay, which would authorize consideration of height up to 130 feet and additional FAR on three sites in Downtown?", "Staff Recommendation on Height for Established Large Sites", "The concept of the Established Large Site Overlay presented in the draft DCP seeks to establish clear expectations in terms of maximum height, appropriate FAR, and open space requirements for three sites in Downtown. The proposal also establishes a rigorous review process that requires a development agreement application and includes additional environmental review and a comprehensive application that demonstrates how the project meets DCP priorities. No Specific Plan Amendment would be required. As legislative actions, development agreements would be subject to the voter approval process already established in State law.", "Staff believes that there are site-specific reasons why allowing for additional height would lead to superior outcomes for future development on these sites. Staff also believes that imposing a clear maximum height for future projects on those sites provides clarity and coherence to protect the integrity of the overall plan that would be absent if property owners/developers could seek consideration for essentially unlimited heights for projects on those sites \u2013 or could seek additional heights on sites where positive trade-offs simply do not apply. Allowing the projects to move forward with the 130\u2019 height would allow flexibility for more ground level public space, preservation of historic buildings and features (currently on two of the three sites) and the opportunity for more distinctive and functional architectural massing, modulation and design.", "Options for Established Large Site Floor Area Ratio (FAR)", "Each of the Established Large Sites have individual FAR parameters, which dictate the mass and scale of the projects.

Were this option to be adopted, it would reduce development potential for two of the three sites and ensure that the development of all three Established Large Sites would not exceed the theoretical development potential of the total land area of all three sites were these parcels developed in a series of typical two- or three-lot projects as opposed to the larger block-level projects that have been proposed.", "Option 3: Modify the DCP\u2019s FAR parameters such that the FAR for each of the three sites would be limited to the maximum FAR established for each Zoning District averaged across the whole site.

The Planning Commission\u2019s recommendation would make all of these ground floor uses non-conforming and replace them with potentially residential or retail uses as change occurs. A 2015 Downtown market outlook report that was used as a point of comparison for the Buildout Analysis demonstrated limits to the amount of retail space that could be feasibly supported in the DCP boundaries. The land use strategy in the DCP establishes the Neighborhood Village District as an area of mixed activity where non-active uses such as residential and office uses could be allowed on the ground floor in mid-block locations only. More active retail and restaurant spaces are strategically targeted for corner locations. The existing retail spaces in these mid-block locations have historically been difficult to lease and the ground floor non-active uses would likely have better compatibility with the residential uses that are anticipated in the district.", "B.

The video would be stored locally for up to 90 days after which the video would then be automatically archived to a secure cloud-based solution integrated within the proposed in-car camera and body worn camera back-end system. The secure cloud-based storage system is hosted by Microsoft using their Azure Government Cloud platform which exceeds FBI standards for security. This proposed hybrid approach to video storage best meets the long-term needs of the Police Department. There is instant access to events occurring within 90 days and there is slightly slower access to events older than 90 days; the older footage would be archived to a secure cloud storage solution for up to the mandatory three-year retention period.

The proposed plant location was in the east portion of the City\u2019s Michigan Avenue Maintenance Yards complex (City Yards). In concept, OTP would provide the City a means of treating an additional 3.5 million gallons of water per day, while simultaneously expediting the cleanup of impaired groundwater quality in the City\u2019s Olympic well field caused by historic industrial releases. A final feasibility report, prepared by the Hathaway Dinwiddie and Black & Veatch consultant team, determined that the cost for the new subgrade OTP facility could exceed $80M; and costs were roughly double that figure for other potential surface improvements related to the City Yards andGandaraPark. Costs for construction of the OTP at the City Yards site were driven largely by the engineering complexities related to subsurface construction, site geotechnical challenges, environmental remediation, and State drinking water regulations. As an alternative, staff initiated a feasibility study to assess modifying and/or expanding the City\u2019s existing Arcadia Treatment Facility to achieve the same treatment capacity and clean up goals as the proposed OTP. Based on the preliminary engineering report it was determined that modification of the Arcadia facility is feasible at significantly lower costs than the proposed OTP. Based on the feasibility and cost savings by expanding Arcadia and not pursuing the OTP, staff has withdrawn the proposed OTP from inclusion in the City Yards Master Plan.

Contractors who provide emergency ambulance services to the City are different from other City contractors subject to the LWO because emergency ambulance providers do not control rates for the services they provide.

The Board adjusts rates annually based on changes to the medical care and transportation line items of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers and, starting July 1, 2017, the percentage change of the Los Angeles County minimum wage change. The County rates are the maximum allowable ambulance rates chargeable to the general public. Thus, while there is an established methodology for increasing rates that takes into account some wage changes, these factors do not include the higher Santa Monica living wage. Additionally, revenue collected by ambulance companies is dependent on the insurance payer mix of the patients transported. Payer mix varies from community to community, and in Santa Monica, approximately one third of payers are Medicare and another third MediCal recipients. These payers pay considerably less to the ambulance company than what is billed. All of these factors, in addition to employee wages, influence the bottom line of any ambulance company providing services in this community.  Some nonprofit organizations rely on State or federal reimbursement and would face similar challenges; these organizations are exempt from the City\u2019s LWO.", "The City\u2019s MWO applies to all businesses, including nonprofit organizations that rely on federal or State funding or externally set reimbursements.

These organizations would still be required to comply with the MWO. This delay would provide time for the industry to adjust to the higher wage model, and would coincide with the minimum wage\u2019s scheduled $15 per hour target in 2020. The recommendation is consistent with prior Council action to exempt banking services in that it is targeted based on specific industry characteristics. It is also consistent with the treatment of nonprofit organizations in the LWO and MWO, some of which share the challenge of externally established service charge rates over which the organizations have no control. Finally, this recommendation is in keeping with the concept of harmonizing the City\u2019s minimum wage, hotel wage, and living wage in the longer term as discussed with the City\u2019s minimum wage law.", "If Council approves staff\u2019s recommendation, staff will issue a new RFP based on the updated LWO.

The analysis examined the net cash flow of the existing condition and projected net cash flow of the temporary field for comparison. In addition to proposed field and parking usage plans, the economic analysis studied capital costs, projected maintenance, operational parking and field costs, projected revenues, and projected savings SMMUSD would achieve by avoiding building parking and a softball field on the Samohi campus.", "Given these considerations, the analysis recommended the City and SMMUSD each contribute 50% of the total project costs, based upon the following assumptions:", "1.  The City would realize all potential parking revenues by the end of the 55-year lease term;", "2.

As noted previously, the City\u2019s contribution would be dependent upon passage of a local bond measure. While it is premature to identify the ultimate size of such a local bond measure, it is clear that a sizable portion of a future funding measure would be required to realize a project of this magnitude. Other priority park needs identified by the community such as the construction of the 12-acre expansion of Airport Park, the expansion of Memorial Park, and land acquisition for new parks, could potentially be deferred if sufficient funding is not available. If voters do not approve such a bond measure, the City would still need to reimburse SMMUSD for 50% of the design costs expended.", "The economic analysis used the aforementioned pro rata share to determine the projected net cash flow for each party for the proposed 55-year term of the joint use agreement (2020 through 2075) for a comparative analysis of existing conditions, a temporary sports field, and a permanent field with subterranean parking. The financial impacts of constructing either a temporary field or the permanent multipurpose sports field with subterranean parking on the Civic Center parking lot would be significant. If a permanent field were built, it is estimated the City\u2019s net cash flow, assuming present value rates, would be -$43.9 million over the full 55-year joint use agreement term. SMMUSD\u2019s net cash flow would be -$4.8 million over the 55-year term of the agreement.", "If a temporary field were built, it is estimated the City\u2019s net cash flow would be -$16.7 million over a 55-year term. To ensure consistency, the economic analysis calculated SMMUSD\u2019s net cash flow for the temporary field as well (-$6.1 million over a 55-year term), with the assumption the City would finance 100% of the temporary project. However, it is important to note the City and SMMUSD staff have not discussed a potential partnership for the temporary field. Furthermore, because the temporary project eliminates most of the surface parking on the Civic Center lot, the project would not provide SMMUSD with guaranteed access to a predetermined number of parking spaces, which is arguably the most valuable financial benefit to SMMUSD of the proposed permanent field and parking partnership.", "Alternatives", "The economic analysis illustrates the immediate and long-term financial impacts that both the permanent and temporary multipurpose sports field options would have on the City and SMMUSD. Given the significant investment and risk that would be required by both agencies, staff recommends Council consider the benefits and costs of each of the aforementioned scenarios as well as the following possible alternatives:", "Alternative 1: Permanent Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with One Level of Subterranean Parking", "One alternative is a permanent multipurpose sports field with the softball field overlay and one level (approximately 325 spaces) of subterranean parking. The preliminary estimated capital cost of this alternative is $60 million and the project timeline would be similar to that of the permanent field with two levels of parking. While the total capital cost is significantly lower than the permanent field with two levels of parking, there would also be fewer benefits. With only 325 parking spaces, the City would likely not be in a position to grant Samohi exclusive access to the number of spaces required to meet the needs of its faculty and staff, making this option less viable as a partnership with SMMUSD. Furthermore, fewer parking spaces would result in less parking availability for City and Courthouse staff and visitors.", "Alternative 2: Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center with Offsite Parking", "Another alternative for consideration is the development of a temporary multipurpose sports field on the Civic Center site with parking leased offsite at a nearby location to accommodate parking needs of the Civic Center, Courthouse, Civic Auditorium, sports field, and Samohi. Staff would proceed with development of a field at the Civic Center and concurrently undertake a process to identify offsite parking, preferably within walking distance of the Civic Center. This alternative would provide parking for the sports field and could meet the parking needs of the City, Courthouse, Samohi, and the Civic Auditorium and possibly, wholly or partially, address the Coastal Commission\u2019s requirements. While this alternative could eliminate the need to build new subterranean parking and thereby save capital costs, the lease costs would need to be negotiated and incurred at least in part by the variety of entities that would utilize the spaces. This option assumes proximate alternative parking sites could be identified within the dynamic development environment and in consideration of future public and private projects near the Civic Center and the Downtown.", "Alternative 3: Defer Development of the Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center, Develop a Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at Memorial Park, and Issue RFP for Civic Auditorium Operator", "The FY 2017-18 CIP Budget includes funding in the amount of $1.35 million for the development of a Master Plan for Memorial Park, which would include both the existing park and the 2.91-acre parcel that currently houses the Colorado Yards (also known as the former Fisher Lumber site). Council could consider directing staff to delay the master planning process and instead proceed with utilizing a portion of the Colorado Yards, combined with reconfiguring some of the existing park facilities and amenities, to design and construct a temporary multipurpose sports field at Memorial Park.", "This multipurpose sports field would be used by Samohi and the community instead of developing the Civic Center field at this time (see Exhibit 3 below). Samohi sports teams currently utilize Memorial Park\u2019s baseball and softball fields as well as the indoor basketball courts. While this alternative would provide an additional multipurpose field centrally located in the City, it would not be adjacent to Samohi thereby requiring students to continue to travel to Memorial Park for practice and games. Should this alternative be constructed, City staff would commit to assist SMMUSD with identifying safe modes of transportation for students from Samohi to the park, including exploring a possible direct shuttle option.", "Following the design process and appropriate environmental review, construction of the field at Memorial Park could potentially begin in July 2019 with the field opening in July 2020. The estimated project timeline would be a faster option than building the proposed temporary field at the Civic Center as a field at Memorial Park would not require a comprehensive parking study or an amendment to the CCSP, and would not require a Coastal Development Permit since it would not be in the coastal zone.", "Staff would proceed concurrently with issuing an RFP for a field design consultant and an RFP for an operator of the Civic Auditorium, per Council\u2019s direction to staff on February 9, 2016 when the Civic Working Group\u2019s Final Report was presented to Council (Attachment A). At that time, staff recommended Council focus on the Civic Auditorium by issuing an RFP for an operator and deferring decisions about the rest of the site until other planning processes had been completed and more information was available (e.g. Samohi Campus Plan, Downtown Community Specific Plan, Airport Park Expansion, and the possible exploration of ways to finance sports fields such as through public-private partnerships). Council directed staff to issue an RFP for an operator with the stipulation that proposals must be consistent with the ECLS as designed and the sports field as represented in the 2005 CCSP. The RFP has not been issued, pending information related to the design and ultimate direction of the sports field.", "Exhibit 3: Temporary Multipurpose Sports Field at Memorial Park", "Alternative 4: Defer Development of the Multipurpose Sports Field at the Civic Center and Issue RFP for Civic Auditorium Operator", "As mentioned above, Council previously directed staff to issue an RFP for an operator with the stipulation that proposals must be consistent with the ECLS as designed and the sports field as represented in the 2005 CCSP. A decision to issue the RFP now and defer the field would likely be supported by Civic Auditorium advocates and preservationists, but strongly opposed by the Samohi advocates and broader community that voiced an immediate need for a multipurpose sports field in close proximity to the high school, as well as a need to implement the plan as contemplated in the 2005 CCSP. This alternative would also not address the need for a softball field near Samohi.", "Commission Action", "The Recreation and Parks Commission considered the temporary and permanent multipurpose Civic Center sports field options at its June 15, 2017 meeting and approved a motion to recommend to Council that it direct staff to move forward with development of the temporary field option. The economic analysis had not been finalized at the time of the meeting and, therefore, the Commission\u2019s decision was based upon the timeline and capital cost considerations. The Commission cited concerns with the permanent field\u2019s overall capital cost as well as dissatisfaction with the possibility of utilizing a large percentage of a potential future parks bond to finance it.", "Summary", "There are opportunities, challenges, and risks associated with each option and alternative considered in this report. Several options and alternatives provide field space in an ideal location but at great financial costs and with significant risks. Considering all factors, the least costly, least risky, and fastest alternative would be to develop a temporary multipurpose sports field at Memorial Park. However, this approach would not meet the desires of the Samohi community who have advocated for a multipurpose sports field with a softball field overlay adjacent to the high school campus. Staff recommends Council consider all costs, risks, and benefits associated with each option and alternative and provide direction to staff on how to proceed.

In response to Council\u2019s direction, staff worked to better integrate sustainability and governance into the Wellbeing Framework in preparation for the FY2017-19 budget. This refined Framework, presented in the Proposed Budget, is built on the longstanding commitments and goals of the Sustainable City Plan and the baseline findings of the first Wellbeing Index from 2015. Staff used the Framework to organize budget proposals, prioritize budget requests and ultimately frame the FY2017\u201119 budget around its six outcome areas (community, place and planet, learning, health, economic opportunity and governance).", "This fall, the next version of the Wellbeing Index will be released.Over the coming year, findings from the next Index and goals from the Sustainable City Plan will be integrated into the Framework.

Staff spoke with Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. regarding extending the Ambassador Program to Reed Park but found it to be cost prohibitive. Siting Ambassadors at Reed Park, which is further from the Downtown core in which the Ambassadors operate, to provide daily hospitality services and restroom monitoring, would cost between $520,000 and $572,000 annually. Therefore,at this time staff is focused on continuing to pursue a site-specific activation strategy of recreational, cultural, and enrichment programs, events, and activities for youth, families, adults, and seniors as well as a communication and outreach campaign.", "As one means to increase programming in and activate Reed Park, staff will return to Council during the summer of 2017 with a proposed reduction to the current annual fee structure for fitness instruction, classes and camps operating in Reed Park and recommendations for a pilot program. Commercial fitness or athletic instruction, classes, or camps in City parks and on Santa Monica State Beach are currently subject to a Permit Fee, which was set by Council in 2013 at $100 and subject to annual CPI increases. An additional $50 Permit Fee is added if an RFP, lottery or other allocation process is required to compensate for additional staff time. In addition to the Permit Fee(s), an annual chargefor use of the City parks and the Santa Monica State Beach is imposed: $1,800 for small group (not more than 2); $3,600 for medium group (not more than 10); $5,400 for large group (more than 10). Currently, a 50% reduction in annual charge is applied for groups operating in Reed Park. Modifying the existing requirements further for Reed Park may incentivize use, potentially attracting new fitness instructors not currently under the permit system and/or entice current permitted instructors to re-locate to Reed Park.", "Homeless Multi-disciplinary Street Team", "Council noted the need to continue funding the Homeless Multi-disciplinary Street Team (HMST), one of the \u201cjump start\u201d projects associated with the Addressing Homelessness Strategic Goal, which began operating in September 2016. The team consists of four full-time staff and a part-time psychiatrist through a contract with The People Concern, joined by medical staff from Venice Family Clinic, and provides care on the streets, in parks, jails and hospitals to the highest utilizers of City emergency services (police, fire, hospitals).

City funding of $300,000 is requested to sustain the program through June2019. The extension of the program would also allow for an assessment of \u201cstep down\u201d interventions post-housing to determine how best to transition participants from HMST to other lower-intensity support services, thereby allowing the team to serve new individuals. Discussions are also underway to engage the business community to support this project as another on-going source of partial funding.", "Staff is recommending that Council approve the transfer of $300,000 in General Fund \u201cjump start\u201d funding in FY 2018-19 to extend the program an additional year as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d project. This extension would result ina strong, multi-year data set upon which to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. As demonstrated by other evaluative tools such as the Wellbeing Index and the Youth Report Card, demonstrating social impact interventions requires consistent multi-year assessments to measure impact over time. RAND will evaluate the program, looking specifically at the effectiveness of the intervention for this highly vulnerable population and to see if the service model results in fewer contacts with local emergency services.", "Social Safety Net", "Council expressed concern that the budget proposed by the Trump Administration could have severe impacts on the members of our community with the greatest need and fewest options.While the federal budget is only a proposal at this point and is expected to undergo significant modification by Congress, the threat is significant.", "A preliminary review of FY 2016-17 funding sources for the 20 Human Services Grants Program (HSGP) funded agencies indicates that they rely on $21 million in federal funding.

Council adopted the Bergamot Area Plan in 2013. It designates the Site as a Conservation Arts Center Zone with a total floor-to-area-ratio (FAR) of 1.0, or one times the parcel size as the total permitted amount of development, reflecting the lowest allowed commercial density in Santa Monica.", "The Site is both highly strategic and highly sensitive for the future of both transportation and local culture \u2013 as well as the fiscal sustainability of Big Blue Bus in a time of dynamic change in transit economics. While some advocate for no changes to the current status quo, the opening of Expo, the sale of the adjacent, privately owned portion of Bergamot Station Arts Center, ongoing changes in the fine-art business, and the closing of the Santa Monica Museum of Art all point to the need to plan for the future vitality of Bergamot Station. Pursuant to Council direction, the City issued a request for qualifications for revitalization of theSite in July 2012, followed by a request for proposals(RFP) in February 2013.

Maximize the preservation of existing buildings, where feasible. Retaining the character of the Arts Center is very important to the community and City.", "4. Incorporate additional uses, which support the Site as a cultural destination, including evening and weekend activation, and uses that help generate revenue for the development. These uses should include a hotel, restaurant/bar, shared community meeting room/performance space and could include creative office and cultural uses that will maximize market opportunities and create a vibrant development.", "5.

The Advisory Committee also determined that off-site parking would need to be constructed before significant revitalization couldoccur. Theopportunity to develop a shared parking structure at the City Yards was identified as critical to the Art Center revitalization. TheAdvisory Committee agreed with the need for offsite parking to replace the existing surface parking at the Site in order to create attractive, flexible open space at the Site to support art events, public art, outdoor dining, and public gathering space.

In response, the Worthe Group analyzed a smaller hotel concept and determined that a hotel under 100 rooms would not be economically viable to operate or finance within the overall project, the limited market of hotel brands that service less than 100-room hotels and the inefficiencies of operating a hotel of that size. Advisory Committee member Richard Peterson who was with the Santa Monica Travel and Tourism organization at the time acknowledged to the committee that this was his understanding of hotel operations as well.

The Advisory Committee recommended that the surface parking be retained until replacement parking is built off site, with the exception of implementing modest landscaping, open space, or other site modifications. Additionally, the committee recommended that the Worthe Group reserve as much peripheral surface parking on-site as needed for the existing galleries and nonprofit cultural uses to conduct business. The Worthe Group proposes to provide the code-required amount of parking for the Arts Center in the proposed shared City Yards Parking Garage, while maintaining a limited amount of on-site surface parking for disabled parking and loading requirements. The Worthe Group would be obligated to finance or lease the Arts Center parking in the proposed shared City Yards Parking Garage.

The estimated construction costs for the revised preliminary plan without the hotel have increased by approximately 11 percent (from $22.2 million in total hard and soft costs to $24.6 million) and the updated pro-formas now include the combined possessory interest and property tax expenses that the plan is expected to incur. The rental revenue cash flows were also updated to reflect the below-market rents the Art Center tenants currently pay adjusted for consumer price index, and the phasing of the plan.", "The revitalization of the Arts Center requires significant financial investment in order to upgrade the Site\u2019s infrastructure and existing buildings, and to construct the new improvements and a shared parking structure. The total estimated costs of the revised preliminary plans are $39.6 million for the plan that does not include a hotel and $95.1 million for the plan that includes a 120-room hotel. Using Worthe\u2019s assumptions, staff asked KMA to model the cost to construct a 100-room hotel, which KMA estimated at $85.7 million.", "Net cash flow from the plan without a hotel before consideration of debt service and return on capital is estimated to be approximately $2.2 million in the first year of full build-out and approximately $6.4 million in the first year of full build-out for the plan with a 120-room hotel. Net cash flow is expected to grow over time as revenues grow. When debt service and return on capital are considered, the plan without a hotel is not expected to repay the capital investors until 2058. The plan with a hotel is not expected to repay the capital investors until 2045. Assuming a 55-year ground lease, the net present value of the net cash flow after debt service and repayment of capital, assuming a 10 percent discount rate, is $4.5 million for the plan without a hotel and $25.8 million for the plan with a hotel. The net present value provides a means to estimate the Worthe Group\u2019s estimated profit over the life of the ground lease.", "It should be noted that the financial pro-formas are preliminary, order-of-magnitude estimates used to test the feasibility of the land-use scenarios. If the plan moves forward, KMA would complete a detailed financial evaluation of the plan as it is further defined. During the preliminary phase, staff asked KMA to provide initial feedback on the Worthe Group\u2019s pro-forma. KMA comments include:", "\u00b7 The loan-to-capital ratio of 65 percent is low compared to most commercial developments, which typically leverage a greater amount of debt. The Worthe Group has responded that they are able to attract a greater amount of capital to their plans.", "\u00b7 The net developer profit is low compared to the overall size of the development. The Worthe Group has responded that they are able to accept lower overall returns because of their long-term investment horizon.", "\u00b7 The time period for repayment of the initial capital investment is extremely long, particularly in the scenario without a hotel. The Worthe Group has responded that their investors are accustomed to longer windows of return on investment, though they acknowledge that the extended time period for the plan without a hotel would face greater challenges in attracting capital.", "\u00b7 Based on the Worthe Group\u2019s Operating Pro-forma and Cash Flow Projections, KMA confirmed that the Worthe Group has the capacity and access to capital to finance the different preliminary plan uses being considered.", "While the City could take the position that financing is purely a developer\u2019s risk, if the Worthe Group is unable to attract debt and capital financing, revitalization of the Arts Center might be delayed.", "In addition, the Worthe Group\u2019s pro-forma assumes that the developer would construct and operate a shared parking structure at the City Yards. Staff believes the concept requires significant further discussion and negotiation between the City and the Worthe Group if the plan moves forward.", "Estimated Public Revenues", "Attachment H identifies estimated annual City revenues of the revised preliminary plan. As noted in Attachment H and highlighted in Table 2 below, the annual City revenues from a preliminary plan without a hotel would generate approximate $1.3 million in annual City revenue. Annual City revenues from a preliminary plan that includes a 120-room hotel use is approximately $2.9 million. KMA estimated the annual City revenues from a hypothetical 100-room hotel at approximately $2.6 million. The most notable difference among the scenarios are the estimated property tax and transient occupancy tax revenues related to a hotel.", "Table 2 - Annual Estimated Revenue to the City", "Revenue Source", "No Hotel", "100-Room Hotel", "120-Room Hotel", "Ground Lease Payment", "$700,000", "$700,000", "$700,000", "Transit Occupancy Tax", "$0", "$1,226,000", "$1,472,000", "City Share of Property Taxes", "$55,000", "$119,000", "$132,000", "Total Estimated Tax Revenue to City\u2019s General Fund", "$640,000", "$1,933,000", "$2,195,000", "Total Overall Estimated Public Revenues", "$1,340,000", "$2,633,000", "$2,895,000", "Lastly, the Worthe Group has committed to a minimum ground rent of $700,000 under each scenario; however, annual ground rent payments are typically equal to a percentage of the supportable land value. If the plan moves forward, KMA would develop a detailed evaluation of the refined plan and its financial pro-forma, in order to support negotiation of a ground-lease structure and profit-sharing opportunities associated with the market-rate uses.", "Market-Rate Uses and Below-Market-Rate Use", "An early policy direction that was included in the RFQ/RFP was the intent of preserving gallery and nonprofit cultural uses at the Arts Center. The City envisioned that the rental rates for cultural uses would be provided at below-market rates, with the recognition that nonprofit arts and cultural space would be discounted at a higher rate than for-profit gallery space. Likewise, it was envisioned that the Site would accommodate market-rate uses such as creative office, restaurants, and a hotel to help offset the below-market rents of the art spaces. The Worthe Group has maintained these lease rate expectations in their financial pro-forma analysis that they have produced throughout the process. TheAdvisory Committee recommendation limits the market-rate uses on the Site to 31percent of the total building square footage, with the remaining 69 percent of the building space at below-market rates. The revised plan by the Worthe Group that includes a 120-room hotel adjusts the balance of building space to 43 percent subsidized space and 57 percent market-rate use. KMA notes that a balance, at a minimum closer to a 50/50 split of below-market and market-rate uses would be more sustainable for the plan by providing more reliable and diverse long-term income to support the below-market uses. A hotel could also support the Art Center tenants by providing a regular stream of visitors to the Site, including supporting restaurants that could incorporate evening service beyond typical gallery hours.", "Council Guidelines", "The Advisory Committee was thoughtful in considering the Council\u2019s guidelines in their recommendations regarding the preliminary plan and mix of uses. The following section briefly discussed each of the Council\u2019s guidelines for the revitalization of the Arts Center with respect to the Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendations.", "Minimize displacement and disruption to the fine art galleries and other creative businesses on the Site \u2013 Retention of existing Bergamot tenants is a priority shared by all participants. The Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendations related to phased construction, temporary relocation options, leasing priority for displaced tenants, off-site parking, and outreach and signage during construction all speak to minimizing impacts on existing tenants. A majority of the Committee also voted against inclusion of a hotel on the Site, which would further minimize disruption, and likely continue to make Building T available for existing creative tenants.", "Incorporate space for additional nonprofit arts and cultural uses - The Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendations would allocate the amount of space available for nonprofit arts and cultural uses by up to 65,700 square feet. If Building T were retained as cultural-focused space, an additional 11,214 square feet could be available for nonprofit culturaluses.", "Support the Expo Station and bus integration through amenities and services (e.g. public restroom, bike center) \u2013 The Advisory Committee envisioned the museum and adjoining caf\u00e9 as a prominent gateway, helping to visually promote and integrate the Arts Center with the Expo Bergamot Station. Although reduced in size from the original Worthe Group proposal, the Advisory Committee also recommended a bike center of 600 square feet in the preliminary plan.", "Add a permanent home for a museum or other significant cultural institution \u2013 The Advisory Committee recommended a 21,100-square-foot museum building adjacent to the Expo station.", "Generate a minimum of $622,000/year ground lease payment, to be increased over time as a revenue source for Big Blue Bus \u2013 The Developer has proposed to set the annual ground rent at $700,000 for each of the three plan scenarios. However, these amounts may be revised up or down based upon further feasibility testing once a more detailed development program is approved.", "Generate additional municipal revenues that could be used to supplement Big Blue Bus funds. \u2013 The role of the Site as a BBB revenue-producing asset adds additional complexity to the overall plan. BBB\u2019s revenues come from a variety of sources, including federal, state, and regional funds, farebox revenue, advertising, and real estate income. When Council voted to increased BBB fares in 2010, Council recognized that higher bus fares have a disproportionate impact on transit-dependent riders who are often at the lowest end of the economic spectrum. Recognizing the impacts, Council directed staff to explore opportunities to maximize returns on BBB real estate in order to reduce pressure on bus fares.", "Bergamot Station represents one of BBB\u2019s primary real estate holdings. If the City\u2019s overriding goal were to maximize ground rent in order to reduce pressure on the BBB fares, significant ground rents could flow to the BBB from a long-term re-positioning of the property. For example, the Papermate site, directly across Olympic Boulevard from the Arts Center, sold in 2015 for a reported price of over $500 per square foot of building area and nearly $400 per square foot of land area. The Arts Center is arguably comparable in terms of location, and if maximizing its value was an overriding priority, it could be expected to command annual rents of several million dollars per year. Giventhat the BBB\u2019s total passenger revenue is projected to be approximately $11 million in FY 2017/2018, generating several million dollars per year from the Arts Center site could dramatically reduce pressure on bus fares. However, because the regulations and plans for the Arts Center envision a low floor-to-area ratio and many subsidized tenants, the expected ground rent to the BBB is not expected to increase significantly.", "Not including the ground lease payment, a plan without a hotel is expected to generate approximately $640,000 annually in additional City revenues, relative to current City revenues of approximately $180,000 generated by the Site. With the inclusion of a hotel, the plan is projected to generate between $1.9 million (100-room hotel) and $2.2 million (120-room hotel) annually in revenue to the City\u2019s General Fund. Theprimary drivers of the increased revenues is Transient Occupancy Tax (with a hotel), supplemented by additional property taxes, and sales taxes. Attachment H provides a summary of expected municipal revenues under the three scenarios.", "Additional municipal revenue derived from the Bergamot Arts Center would go to the City\u2019s General Fund, though Council could choose to allocate some or all of the increased revenue to support the BBB, given the low ground-rents that are expected to accrue to the BBB. The additional Bergamot ground rent revenue, coupled with any additional public revenues earmarked to the BBB, could help to reduce pressure on bus fares, as the BBB grapples with the cost increases that are similar to those facing the City generally (pension costs, workers compensation, health care), as well as revenue impacts related to regional and national declines in bus ridership. Understanding that the Council has consistently reinforced that revenues from the Site should be used to keep fares low for Santa Monica residents and BBB customers, and that BBB has one of the lowest transit fares in the county, additional Site revenue could help BBB reduce pressure on fare increases. As a result, the City\u2019s choices regarding the project are expected to affect bus fares for BBB customers in the long run.", "Alternatives for the Site", "Council could consider alternative approaches to the preliminary plan. Council could direct the Worthe Group to pursue incorporation of either a 100-room, six-story hotel or a 120-room, seven-story hotel. If Council does not support a hotel use on the Site, staff requests that Council provide direction on the desired use(s) for the T building (as either gallery, nonprofit arts use, cultural; restaurant/caf\u00e9 or creative office) or if another use/building for the location be considered.", "Additional alternatives for Council consideration include retaining the existing uses, buildings, and conditions on the Site, including the surface parking and allowing the ENA with the Worthe Group to expire, though this approach would not address many of the guidelines established for the Site. Council could also direct staff to prepare a new RFP with revised project goals and directives, if the proposed preliminary plan is not deemed acceptable. The approach would delay implementation of many of the guidelines, as well as extending uncertainties as to the City\u2019s plans for the Site, which could cause further concern to the current tenants and disruption to the on-going operations of the Arts Center.", "Exclusive Negotiating Agreement (ENA)", "The ENA between the City and the Worthe Group expires on August 31, 2017. IfCouncil is supportive of proceeding with the revitalization of the Arts Center and continuing to partner with the Worthe Group, staff recommends Council authorize an extension to the ENA. The recommended extension is for a term of three years with two, one-year options conditioned upon the Worthe Group working in good faith to implement the revised preliminary plan selected by Council. This extension time period will allow the Worthe Group to continue their efforts to obtain the necessary land use entitlements and approvals. There is no cost to either the City or the Worthe Group in extending the ENA.", "Interim Property Management", "The Master Lease Agreement with Bergamot Station Ltd. expires on December31,2017, at which time the existing tenants\u2019 subleases and parking agreements on the Site will expire as they run concurrent with the master lease. Staff has identified four potential options for interim management or ground leasing for Council consideration.", "1. If Council decides to proceed with revitalization of the Arts Center and continue to partner with the Worthe Group, then the City could enter into an interim master lease with the Worthe Group to oversee the management of the Site until land-use entitlements are in place and a long-term ground lease is executed. This approach would provide the Worthe Group with an opportunity to begin working with the Arts Center tenants in advance of any significant revitalization.", "2. The City could extend the current lease with Mr. Blank (Bergamot Station Ltd.) during the interim, which could enable continuation of some of the existing arrangements, such as parking agreements with Agensys and the owner of the privately owned portion of the Arts Center.", "3. The City could act a direct lessor, with individual leases with each tenant and overall property management responsibility. Because staff does not have capacity or expertise in providing direct property management, a property management contract would be necessary. However, such an approach is not recommended because City oversight of leasing responsibilities could have negative consequences for the Arts Center, as each lease would be subject to the competitive public procurement process. When vacancies occur, re-leasing could be significantly delayed, potentially creating extended vacancies that detract from the vitality of the Arts Center.", "4. Select a third-party, interim ground lessee who could manage the property and take responsibility for leasing. Staff does not recommend such an approach as completing the process of procuring a ground lessee, as well as executing a ground lease, could extend beyond expiration of the current ground lease and create further uncertainty among Arts Center tenants.", "If Council approves the extension of the ENA with the Worthe Group, staff recommends that the City enter into an interim ground lease with the Worthe Group pursuant to the following parameters:", "A. The term of the interim ground lease should be three years with two, one-year options at the City\u2019s sole discretion.", "A revitalization plan could be expected to undergo environmental review, obtain entitlements, and enter into a long-term ground lease with theCity over a two to four-year period. The interim ground lease would spell out what occurs until construction begins. If the environmental review or entitlement period is extended beyond the three-year period, the ground lease options could be exercised.", "B. During the term of the interim ground lease, sublease rents may increase by no more than the Consumer Price Index.", "Many Arts Center tenants\u2019 continued viability is a concern if their subleases are subject to significant rent increases. The proposed parameter is designed to ensure rent stability.", "C.

The proposed parameter would ensure that excess income would be invested in the Site.", "Commission Action", "Staff presented the preliminary plan, associated analysis, and interim site management options to the Arts Commission on April 17, 2017. Approximately 30 members of the public attended, including former members of the Bergamot Advisory Committee and Bergamot tenants. The commission had a variety of questions regarding the plan concepts and process going forward with particular concern raised about protecting the art uses at the Site. The Arts Commission met again on May 15, 2017 to develop their recommendations, with input from the Arts Commission\u2019s Bergamot Ad Hoc Committee, which is comprised of five members of the Arts Commission. Seventeen members of the public attended the meeting, including Bergamot tenants, City staff and the developer\u2019s team. The Arts Commission reviewed and discussed the Bergamot Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s recommendations, which formed the Commission\u2019s recommendations to Council.", "The Arts Commission recommended that the ENA with the Worthe Group be extended for three years and that the Worthe Group be selected as the interim ground lessee. TheCommission also recommended a variety of leasing policies for the Site during the interim management of the Arts Center. The Commission has committed to develop an arts management plan for the Arts Center with the assistance of a newly formed Arts Center management committee (Arts Management Committee) in which representatives comprised of Bergamot tenants and community representatives would be represented, following the form and guidelines established for the Public Art Committee of the Arts Commission. TheArts Management Committee would prepare a draft arts management plan within twelve months to address curation of arts programming, guidelines for tenancy selection, and preserving the art uses and architectural character of Bergamot. The Committee would report back to the Arts Commission to recommend an Arts Management Plan to Council. The Arts Commission incorporated their overall recommendations in a memo (Attachment I).", "In addition, the Worthe Group submitted a letter to the Arts Commission (Attachment J) in which Worthe proposes to form a non-profit organization to implement the Arts Center Management Plan.

The recent prudent decision by CalPERS to lower rate of return assumptions on its investment portfolio is anticipated to increase the City\u2019s employer contribution rates by 50% within five years, an increase that makes up $13 million of the General Fund\u2019s projected $19 million shortfall in FY 2021-22.", "The City has consistently taken steps to mitigate increases in its pension costs using a combination of pay downs of its unfunded liability, employee cost-sharing, and prepayments that result in discounted costs. The City\u2019s fiscal policies establish annual payments above the annual required contribution to CalPERS that accelerate the paying down of the City\u2019s unfunded pension liability. The payments are for a minimum of $1 million in the General Fund and a commensurate amount in all other funds. The policy also provides for additional payments if funds are available. As the fiscal year nears its end, and with the threat of significant cost increases ahead, staff has reviewed current balances in its reserves and has identified $35,080,812 in General Fund reserves and $8,639,607 in other operating funds\u2019 reserves that may be used to increase this year\u2019s annual payment from $1,279,581 to $45,000,000.  The annual retirement cost savings to the City from these payments will be at least $3.8 million. To achieve savings as soon as FY 2017-18, CalPERS requires payment prior to June 20, 2017.", "In order to make the payment, it is necessary for the General Fund to advance a loan to the Rent Control Fund in the amount of $519,669.", "Background", "On June 21, 2011 (Attachment A), June 12, 2012 (Attachment B), June 24, 2014 (Attachment C), and June 9, 2015 (Attachment D), Council authorized lump sum payments to CalPERS totaling $30.1 million. Additionally, staff made a budgeted $1.2 million annual payment in June 2016, and the FY 2016-17 budget includes a $1.26 million Citywide payment.", "Discussion", "The City of Santa Monica has a healthy balance sheet with over $1.5 billion in net assets, including substantial cash reserves and well-maintained public infrastructure and consistently balanced operating budgets. All these factors contribute to the AAA bond rating from all three major credit rating agencies. However, retirement costs are a large part of the City\u2019s annual budgets and affect long term financial sustainability. According to our most recent audited Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, total pension assets held by CalPERS were valued at $1,160,937,160 with a net unfunded liability of $386,760,127. The unfunded liability is the gap between the value of the funds members have paid into the pension fund to cover employee pensions over time, and the actual cost of the benefits in the future. The unfunded liability portion of the ARC is based on paying down the gap over a period of 30 years.", "Each year, the City pays the annual required contribution (ARC), as set by CalPERS. The ARC includes the cost of benefits each employee accrues each year, and an amount to pay for the unfunded liability of the plan. In recent years, changes in the assumptions used to determine plan participant demographics, the methodology used to incorporate market fluctuations into annual contributions, and low investment returns have increased the unfunded liability amount significantly. Pension costs make up approximately 7% of the City\u2019s overall budget and 10% of the operating budget, and to a large extent are outside staff\u2019s direct control.", "Paying down the unfunded liability at an accelerated level leads to decreased future liabilities, and therefore results in savings in required payments now and in the future.  Investing funds in the CalPERS portfolio can also yield a higher return than staff would expect in the City\u2019s portfolio, which is limited by restrictions mandated by State law.", "Council has supported this strategy by approving prior payments totaling $31.3 million to date, and adopting a policy ensuring that, if funds are available, the City will continue to make payments of at least $1 million in the General Fund and commensurate amounts in other funds annually, which translated to a total of $1.2 million in FY 2015-16. In general, staff recommends paying more than the minimum, depending on fund availability, as the ongoing savings generated from such payments provide a strong return on investment. The $45 million proposed payment will use $35 million in funds that have been set aside in the General Fund reserves as a potential supplement to future capital budgets, including City Yards modernization and contingency, as well as $8.6 million in fund balance reserves in other funds.", "While most funds have the necessary reserves on hand to make the pay down, staff recommends that the General Fund make forgivable loans to the Housing Authority and Pier Funds in the amounts of $200,589 and $235,458, respectively, to make the paydown, as both funds are projected to require subsidies in the next two years. Additionally, staff recommends that the General Fund would loan funds to the Rent Control Fund for its $519,669 portion of the pay down, allowing the Board the time to incorporate this additional cost into their budget.  Staff will work with the Rent Control Board to negotiate a repayment plan of this amount at a proposed annual interest rate of 1.3%, reflecting the amount earned on the City\u2019s portfolio.", "Staff estimates that the $45 million payment would result in $3.8 million in on-going savings, $3 million of which would be in the General Fund. This payment would bring the total unfunded liability paydown through June 30, 2017 to $76.3 million and decrease the unfunded liability amount by an additional 11%.  In addition, in response to staff\u2019s request for an updated contribution forecast, CalPERS applied new information that reflects slightly better performance in the City\u2019s experience level and market returns to the City\u2019s plan. The updated information has allowed CalPERS to lower the pre-paydown contribution amounts by up to $4 million annually citywide beginning in FY 2018-19.  Barring any other changes, the combination of these two changes would decrease the General Fund deficit in FY 2021-22 by $6 million.", "Upon receiving the payment, CalPERS will recalculate the City\u2019s required payment for the following fiscal year, based on the associated lower liability. For the FY 2017-18 fiscal year, CalPERS has set a June 20, 2017 deadline to receive the payment and recalculate FY 2017-18 employer contribution requirements.

If the calculated water demand from the proposed new development is greater than the amount the property currently uses (using a five-year average), then the developer must attempt to design a more water-efficient property through fixtures and systems (e.g. graywater and rain water harvesting). If the new development is still projected to use more water after all practical water-saving devices and systems are included in the design, then an in-lieu fee is required. Those fees pay to retrofit existing off-site buildings with water-saving fixtures to offset the additional water demand of the new development.", "Once approved, the calculated water demand for the new development would be used as the Allowance for the property during a declared water supply shortage providing a realistic yet water-conserving target. Currently, Allowances are a 20% reduction from usage in 2013. New developments that calculate greater water use than the current property\u2019s five-year average would not likely meet Allowances as defined and, subsequently, could be fined for exceedances. This would trigger requests for adjustments to their Allowances. These adjustment requests would be granted because the developments would be built to the current water-efficient building requirements, which is a pre-requisite for an adjustment.", "Setting the new development\u2019s Allowance as the calculated and approved water demand provides the most accurate water budget and would lead to fewer exceedance citations issued and fewer adjustment requests. Requiring the Allowance to equal the approved new water demand will encourage designer(s) of new developments to produce accurate estimations to help their clients avoid Allowance exceedance penalties.

These are not allowable expenses under the UASI grant. The cost of those two items is estimated at $7,500 and will be absorbed by the Police Department\u2019s existing operating budget. The bomb detection canine would be a highly trained detection dog assigned to a law enforcement handler. Current officers will have the opportunity to apply, through a standardized selection process, for the canine handler position. The team would conduct searches of buildings, parking structures, office areas, vehicles, and suspicious packages for various explosive materials near not only critical City infrastructure such as City Hall, 3rd Street Promenade, the Pier, the airport, and water and communication hubs, but also during high-profile events including LA Marathon, GLOW, concerts at the Pier, dignitary visits, and large-scale gatherings associated with Hollywood award events throughout the year.  This project will enhance the Santa Monica Police Department's current canine program, which consists of three canine teams, by expanding its detection and response capabilities with the addition of one explosive detection team comprised of one officer and one canine. The canine and related training will be funded by the grant. Maintaining explosive detection capabilities at critical infrastructure has been an ongoing UASI project for the region's law enforcement throughout the life of the UASI program. The City\u2019s new Expo infrastructure, as well as all the aforementioned locations, would benefit from an explosive detection team not only during particular events, but also year-round as the canine team would perform random sweeps.

Ongoing maintenance costs related to the system will be absorbed within the Police Department\u2019s operating budget. The funding would replace a system installed more than 10 years ago with newer technology.  On a daily basis, the Third Street Promenade is one of the busiest pedestrian-focused areas in the region. It is an extremely popular destination to visitors from all over the world. The upgraded camera system would serve as a key tool to protect this internationally known and vital asset. The information gathered by the security cameras could provide the information necessary to prevent or respond to a terrorist incident on Third Street in Santa Monica; the system would also enhance terrorist prevention capabilities in Santa Monica.

The Framework, which captures work on strategic goals as well as departmental and citywide programs, policies and projects, is built on the City\u2019s long-term commitment to sustainability and its new Wellbeing Index.  It begins the City\u2019s shift towards a unified performance management system called SaMoStat.  The Framework is a living tool that will evolve as staff, with community input, targets services, policy initiatives and projects that will help move the dial on key outcomes and then develops metrics to monitor progress in meeting these outcomes. In the future, staff will collect and analyze relevant data and will use this Framework to make resource and programmatic decisions, and to address operational challenges, including how to most effectively meet needs for services using increasingly limited resources.", "In addition to the new Framework, the City has taken steps to control costs in the FY2017-19 Proposed Budget and beyond by reallocating over $4 million in General Fund budget to areas requiring additional focus, rather than adding resources.

A significant portion of the Non-General Fund budget increase is due to budget appropriations for affordable housing that total $19.5 million. These funds are comprised of redevelopment-related loan repayments and settlement payments that are being set-aside for affordable housing development. The FY 2017-18 budget also includes an increase of $14.5 million to maintain or improve water, wastewater, and stormwater runoff infrastructure, including the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP), Water Main Replacement project, the Clean Beaches Project, and drainage improvements.  The remaining significant Non-General Fund increases are from an appropriation of $2.9 million in Transportation Impact Fee Revenues for Lincoln Blvd. Streetscape Improvements and $1.8 million in the Airport Fund toward the airport runway reduction project.  Pier Fund projects were adjusted to accommodate the most updated priorities for Pier infrastructure maintenance, and budget increases in the Internal Service funds will accommodate increasing technology needs and new vehicle management technology.", "All but one of the proposed budget increases can be fully supported by an existing enterprise fund balance or special revenue source; the Pier Fund will require a General Fund subsidy of $1.4 million to fund capital needs in FY 2017-18.

It is City policy to achieve full cost recovery for these services, with some exceptions.  The Community & Cultural Services Department (CCS) fees, which average 32% cost recovery, are based on a pricing policy that reflects Council priorities for community recreation and social services benefits. At this time, staff is proposing no changes to CCS fees (with the exception of the Beach House) because following the adoption of the FY 2017-19 budget, staff will conduct a thorough analysis of CREST and Community Recreation program fees in order to develop proposed fee adjustments with an appropriate strategy for community stakeholder engagement.  Animal Control fees are also less than cost covering as cities traditionally subsidize these services to encourage licensing spaying/neutering. Some other fees are recommended for less than full cost recovery due to previous Council direction or statutory limits.", "A recent study prepared by MGT of America analyzed the cost of services in the Planning and Community Development, Public Works, Police, Fire, Community and Cultural Services, the Records and Election Services Departments as well as the Library.

Based on the study, which included the analysis of approximately 635 fees, staff recommends creating 40 new user fees and 2 new fines/penalty charges. Twenty nine of the new items are in the General Fund, increasing most fees to an appropriate level of cost recovery, reducing 89 fees, and eliminating 43 fees.

Four proposals were received and Xerox (then ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc.) was unanimously selected as the best bidder based on price, range of products and services offered, ability to address the Westside cities\u2019 issues, and commitment to implement an integrated parking solution.", "On May 11, 2010, Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute agreement # 9210 (CCS) with ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc. in the estimated average amount of $1,400,000 per year for a period of five years, with two additional two-year renewal options, to provide parking citation processing, parking permit fulfillment, and payment processing services. The parking permit fulfillment portion of the agreement would be implemented in four phases as Xerox had to build new software solutions to provide the services. In April 2012 agreement #9210 (CCS) was assigned to Xerox following the name change as a result of ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc. being acquired by Xerox.", "There have been three modifications to agreement #9210 (CCS) through administrative procedures as these modifications did not alter the terms or contract amount. On July 10, 2012, the City issued a first modification to accommodate new functionality and clarify services to be provided by Xerox, including allowing Xerox to also accept American Express payments in addition to VISA and MasterCard and allowing the City to purchase permit stock from Xerox per the City\u2019s specifications. On February 13, 2013, the City issued a second modification to accommodate reimbursement to Xerox for postage and mailing costs related to the services provided. On June 23, 2015, the City issued a third modification to exercise the first renewal option and extend the term to June 30, 2017, clarify the additional services to be performed by Xerox per the original agreement, and revise the pricing schedule.", "Discussion", "The City has had an agreement with Xerox since July 2010 for parking citation processing, parking permit fulfillment, and payment processing services. Agreement #9210 (CCS) with Xerox expires on June 30, 2017 with one remaining two-year renewal option.", "Xerox assists the City with the administrative processes of the parking citations the City issues. Xerox processes the citations by uploading the citations to its citation and permit management system daily; accepting citation payments in person, by mail or online; responding to phone inquiries; and mailing legal and payment notices to the vehicles\u2019 registered owners. The California vehicle code entitles registered owners to certain appeal processes after a citation is issued. These appeal procedures consist of an initial review and/or an administrative hearing. Xerox is tasked with the intake of these appeals, assigning them to the appropriate departments for response, managing the administrative hearing schedules, and notifying the register owners of the appeal decisions. In addition, Xerox is tasked with the collection of unpaid citations. Xerox, on behalf of the City, notifies the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and/or Franchise Tax Board (FTB) of any unpaid citations, tracks the remittances intercepted by these agencies, and applies them to the appropriate citations accordingly.", "In 2016 the City issued over 280,000 parking citations. Approximately 18,500 of these citations resulted in the customers requesting an initial review for the validity of the citation, and 1,800 of the customers found to be liable proceeded to request an administrative hearing from the City\u2019s hearing officer for an independent review. As a result, Xerox responded to over 40,000 phone inquiries, and mailed 13,000 unpaid notices to DMV and 1,000 notices to FTB respectively.", "For parking permit processing, Xerox is responsible for processing over 50,000 parking permit renewals every year for the preferential parking program. There are four renewal cycles every calendar year with a total of over 20,000 customer accounts. Xerox works closely with staff to send out renewal notices to existing account holders and process the renewals accordingly. Customers can renew their permits online or by mail. Xerox houses and maintains the permit stock on the City\u2019s behalf.", "Finally, Xerox provides payment processing services related to parking citation processing and parking permit fulfillment including lockbox services, which helps simplify collection and processing of receivable payments.", "Assignment of Agreement", "On January 29, 2016, Xerox announced its plan to separate into two independent, publicly traded Fortune 500 companies: a document technology company known as Xerox Corporation and a business process outsourcing company known as Conduent Incorporated. The separation concluded and, as of January 1, 2017, the business process services provided by Xerox Corporation is now conducted under the new name Conduent, Inc. As of February 16, 2017, Xerox State & Local Solutions, Inc., an indirect but wholly owned subsidiary of Conduent, Inc. changed its name to Conduent State & Local Solutions, Inc. to align itself more clearly with the Conduent brand. The name change does not affect the contract between Conduent and its customers and business partners as Conduent State & Local Solutions, Inc. remains the same legal entity with the same employer identification number (EIN) after the name change.", "Contract Extension", "Staff explored the possibility of issuing a new RFP to obtain a new service provider for the range of services currently provided by Xerox. This exploration was also intended to identify available new technologies relating to citation/permit issuance and management since the contract was executed. While new and improved technologies exist, there are few companies that are able to provide the full range of services desired by the City. Staff recommends extending the agreement with Xerox to minimize any service interruptions while continuing to allow staff to explore other possibilities for the best integrated parking solution.", "Contract Modifications", "The amount of the agreement is dependent on the number of citations and parking permits issued. The original agreement was approved at an estimated amount of $1,400,000 per year, or $12.6 million for the duration of the agreement if all renewal options were exercised. The City has spent close to $9.4 million since the inception of the agreement through FY 2015-16, and is projected to spend an estimated additional amount of $4.6 million between FY 2016-17 and FY 2018-19 on all contracted services, bringing the estimated total to $14 million for the duration of the agreement. Staff recommends a fourth modification in the estimated amount of $1.9 million (includes 10% contingency), with an estimated agreement amount of $14.5 million, with future year funding contingent on Council budget approval.", "Staff also recommends a fourth modification of the agreement to include some provisions that are now City standards for contractual services such as terminating an agreement at the City\u2019s convenience.", "While Xerox has primarily met its contractual obligations, there have been a few performance issues since contract inception. During the same time period, the Parking Operations Division experienced several staff turnovers, which created continuity issues and made contract oversight more challenging. In 2016 staff met with Xerox management on multiple occasions to address the performance issues. Xerox\u2019s contract performance has greatly improved and staff is working closely with the Xerox team to continue to improve and ensure a seamless contracting relationship.", "To more effectively manage this agreement, staff recommends the following conditions in the fourth modification:", "\u00b7 Extend the term to June 30, 2018 and provide one remaining one-year renewal option. The total contract term remains at nine years. Following the last option period, staff will issue a new RFP for citation and permit processing services.", "\u00b7 Include an option for the City to terminate the agreement for convenience.", "\u00b7 Include an option to allow the City to terminate the agreement in parts or in whole.", "\u00b7 Revise the performance standards for parking permit fulfillment to include a penalty provision so it is consistent for all contracted services.", "Vendor Selection", "On November 23, 2009, the three Westside cities of Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and Beverly Hills jointly issued a RFP for citation processing, handheld devices, license plate readers, and permit processing systems. The RFP was broadly publicized by all three cities. Four proposals were received to deliver all requested services; one proposal was received for only handheld citation devices. A selection committee of representatives from all three cities reviewed the proposals and unanimously selected Xerox (then ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc.) as the best bidder based on price, range of products and services offered, ability to address the Westside cities\u2019 issues, and commitment to implement an integrated parking solution.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "The agreement modification to be awarded to Conduent State & Local Solutions, Inc. is $1.9 million, for an amended estimated agreement amount of $14.5 million. Funds are available in the FY 2017-19 proposed budget in the Finance and Planning & Community Development departments.

Santa Monica has been a pioneer in reviving the principle that \u201cstreets are for people\u201d whether they are walking, biking, taking transit or driving their own vehicles. We are, however, a long way from reversing the legacy of engineering and investment decisions that advantaged auto mobility and relegated pedestrian, bike, and transit mobility to second-class status at best.", "Looking ahead, the landscape of mobility is changing rapidly due to policy and technology evolution. In this time of transition, Santa Monica can continue to be a leader in new ways of designing, managing and regulating our streets to serve all people, guided by community values of sustainability, diversity, and wellbeing. It is important to recognize, however, the scale of this challenge \u2013 and the opportunity it represents for Santa Monica to be a model for enhancing transportation choices, innovation and safety.", "Background", "At the February 14, 2017, City Council Meeting, Council instructed staff to prepare a report documenting the progress of several initiatives, including the Pedestrian Action Plan, Bicycle Action Plan, and Vision Zero. The report took on greater urgency when the City experienced a cluster of vehicle/pedestrian collisions that resulted in severe injuries and, for some of the victims, death. Santa Monica is generally, and rightfully, considered a very safe city, and the incidents caused consternation and dismay among residents, City staff, and the City Council. To address those concerns in the context of the initiatives referenced above, the City Manager encouraged staff from the Mobility Division and the SMPD to look deeper into data collected by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the SMPD related to traffic collisions within our borders.", "The Data", "SMPD\u2019s Traffic Enforcement Unit, a subsection of the Strategic Services Division, completed a survey of data related to traffic collisions that occurred on City roadways from January 2013 to April 2017. The Traffic Enforcement Unit examined all traffic related incidents involving vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, and motorcycles, and the primary collision factors associated with each collision. SMPD utilizes these statistics to determine the most efficient deployment of police education and enforcement resources, with the ultimate goal of reducing traffic collisions and achieving Vision Zero.", "The Mobility Division culled information from the CHP database, and combined that with statistics from the SMPD, to create several charts and graphs studying trends in City traffic collisions. The current and potential uses for this data include (1) increasing safety and safety-awareness for drivers, riders, and pedestrians; (2) identifying, if possible, any patterns or behaviors that might be made safer; (3) testing the most appropriate metrics to quantify safety on City roadways; and (4) using the data to inform concerned citizens that Santa Monica continues to be a safe place to ride, walk, and drive.", "The Goals and Plans", "Council\u2019s adoption of Establishing a New Model for Mobility as a strategic goal is consistent with the City\u2019s proactive and on-going work on mobility policy, programs and implementation. The Mobility Strategic Goal encourages people to use diverse and growing mobility options. Vision Zero is one of the three preliminary targets for the Mobility Strategic Goal, along with increasing the use of walking, biking, transit and shared rides, and the creation of a complete mobility network that supports the whole trip and multiple user needs. Financial resources were allocated in FY15-16 to jump-start projects such as the Downtown Crosswalk Scrambles and outreach for Expo Light Rail/GoSaMo. Strategic Goal outcomes are being integrated into the emerging citywide performance management framework.", "Santa Monica\u2019s Pedestrian Action Plan, adopted in February, 2016, is a citywide policy document that provides a focused evaluation of walking in Santa Monica, and outlines specific actions that improve the conditions and comfort for people walking. It builds upon the vision of the 2010 Land Use and Circulation Element (LUCE) as well as the Sustainable City Plan. The Pedestrian Action Plan was generated from community input, detailed data analysis, and interdepartmental collaboration among the Police, Community and Cultural Services, Public Works and Planning and Community Development Departments. It is based on detailed analysis of many factors, including where pedestrian demand is highest, where pedestrian facilities could be improved, and where pedestrian collisions occurred over an 11-year period. It forecasted changes in pedestrian demand due to Expo Light Rail. The Pedestrian Action Plan includes a target for reducing and ultimately eliminating fatal and severe roadway collisions, internationally known as \u201cVision Zero,\u201d a priority expressed by Council in March 2015.", "The Bike Action Plan was adopted in November 2011, to guide City efforts to get people onto bikes, to promote safe bicycling, to encourage effective collaboration with community partners, and to help the City compete successfully for grant funding. The Bike Action Plan called for an increase in bicycling from 3% of trips to 14-35% by 2030. The Plan outlined five- and twenty-year goals for implementation of programs (education, awareness, events, and enforcement), creating support facilities (bike parking, bike centers), and construction/improvement of bikeways. With aggressive mode share targets, the Plan sought to make bicycling fun for everyone, as well as convenient and comfortable through a range of physical facilities and activities. The Bike Action Plan was the first implementation effort of the LUCE focused on creating complete streets that welcome pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and drivers.", "Discussion", "Each year since 2013 staff has prepared a Bike Action Plan implementation report for the Planning Commission. This year a joint report on the Pedestrian and Bike Action Plans was prepared and presented with an overall mobility update at the March 1, 2017 meeting (see Attachment A). With the opening of Expo Light Rail, the Colorado Esplanade and California Incline, service changes from Big Blue Bus and growth of Breeze Bike Share, there was a lot to report. Pursuit of the Council\u2019s Strategic Goal for a new model of mobility along with continued implementation of plans and projects brought a new enthusiasm for mobility and particularly bicycling and walking citywide.", "Important as this Strategic Goal is to the Council and the community, it is one of many competing for capital investment, staff time and public engagement. There are vocal advocates for each mode of transportation (including, especially, the automobile). Remaking the street network to equalize access and promote shared usage and safety requires not only substantial financial commitment, but equally substantial commitment to ongoing management, public engagement and education -- as well as the political will to take the long view of change in the face of vigorous defense of the status quo when it comes to street design, parking policy and traffic enforcement.", "So far in 2017, Santa Monica has seen an unusual spike in pedestrian-involved collisions. Some have resulted in severe injury and fatality. When a person is killed or severely injured it affects families and friends, neighbors, employers and many others. That is one reason why the Council adopted a target to reduce and ultimately eliminate roadway fatalities and severe injuries. Santa Monica joined in this relatively new movement of Vision Zero cities with adoption of the Pedestrian Action Plan that defines a ten-year target. Walking is a part of the Santa Monica culture, along with being part of a compassionate community that wants to be informed and responsible, and to enjoy roadways that provide attractive and comfortable environments for everyone. This report shares some baseline data and shares best practices for Vision Zero from other cities. Vision Zero was adopted in the Pedestrian Action Plan, but Vision Zero is a movement to protect everyone on the road regardless of what mode they are taking today.", "The numbers of pedestrian-involved collisions nationwide has grown to 15%, up from 11% in 2006. In California, pedestrians continue to make up 25% of all roadway deaths, even though numbers fell slightly in 2016. While the City of Los Angeles does not have citywide data for pedestrian-involved collisions this year, the Los Angeles Times recently published findings that collisions are up 43% from 2015 to 2016 in the City of Los Angeles, with similar trend data for 2017 thus far. The recent spate of both fatal and injury incidents involving cars and pedestrians appears to be part of a larger pattern of vehicle/pedestrian collisions observed nationwide.", "Data Analysis", "Traffic incident reports are taken by the Police Department for any crash with reported injury (including complaint of pain). The California Highway Patrol consolidates reports from all statewide agencies into a publicly-available database called the Statewide Integrated Traffic Reporting System (SWITRS). Historic collision data from these reports can begin to tell a story about the patterns and possible causes of collisions. A long view of many years can reveal patterns that may not appear when the sample sizes are smaller and over shorter timeframes. Three levels of data were reviewed for this staff report to begin to understand trends, and as a baseline for future detailed investigation as the Vision Zero program develops.", "\u00b7 Police Department records of all reported collision and citations from January 1, 2013 to April 26, 2017", "\u00b7 SWITRS records of all reported collisions from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016", "\u00b7 Pedestrian Action Plan analysis of SWITRS and Police Department reported collisions 2001-2011", "Crash Frequency", "Overall, the City of Santa Monica has seen a slight decrease in crash frequency since 2013, the first year that California law changed its reporting system and removed a mandate that required agencies to take reports at the scene of all incidents. Since the law was passed, agencies like SMPD are only required to take a report if there was an injury involved (including complaint of pain). For consistency in reporting, 2013 was chosen as the date to begin the data analysis. Just over 1,500 traffic incidents were reported in Santa Monica in 2013. It dropped to approximately 1,400 in 2014 and has remained stable through 2015 and 2016.", "The SWITRS database records severity of injury for all parties. From 2006 to 2016, SWITRS data show 285 total fatal and severe injuries in Santa Monica, or an average of 26 per year. Year over year, the fewest fatalities and severe injuries were reported in 2010 with 20, and the highest was 37 in 2011. At least one fatality occurs each year, with a peak reported of six fatalities in three of the study years.", "Vehicles are the only parties in 82% of traffic incidents. Incidents involving people walking and biking are 8% and 10% respectively. Of the severe injuries reported in SWITRS, people walking and driving each represent approximately 40%, with people bicycling making up most of the remaining 20% of severe injuries. Of reported fatalities, people walking are 62%, while people in vehicles are 28% and bicyclists are 8%. People driving motorcycles are 1% of severe injuries, and 3% of fatalities.", "People walking and biking make up 60% of severe injuries and 70% of fatalities. This means they are many times more likely to killed or severely injured if involved in a collision, which is why they are sometimes referred to as having higher vulnerability or exposure on the roadway.", "Time and Day", "The time of day is an important factor in the incidence of collisions, because it relates to daylight levels, traffic patterns, traffic volumes and other patterns of behavior. The highest number of all collisions occurred between 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. which is also a period of high activity. Residents take trips in almost equal amounts in the morning (8:00 a.m.) and evening (6:00 p.m.), according to the 2016 Resident Travel Survey, but severe injury crashes are more frequent in the evening. Fatal incidents have a less clear trend, but maintain a consistent level after 7:00 p.m. when other severe injury crashes are falling.", "While there were no large differences between days of the week, Monday and Wednesday experience the highest number of traffic fatalities and severe injuries, and Friday has the lowest. No noticeable increase is seen weekends which tend to be busier in the Downtown and Beach areas.", "Involved Parties", "The distribution of all fatal and severe injury crashes roughly follows the population distribution, except for young adults. People ages 15-24 make up approximately 9% of the population, but almost 16% of overall fatalities and severe injuries. However the distribution shifts for walking incidents, in which older age groups are over-represented among those killed or severely injured. People aged 55-64 make up 12.6% of the population, but 23% of walking incidents, and people aged 75-84 are 4.7% of the population and 11% of people killed or severely injured walking.", "Geographical Analysis, 2013-2017 (YTD)", "Incidents are happening throughout Santa Monica, but trends mirror the findings of the Pedestrian Action Plan. As the following incident maps illustrate, major intersections and thoroughfares that have the highest volume of traffic also have the highest rates of collisions. The sheer number of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles traveling on Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, Ocean Avenue, and other main streets creates additional exposure. When two main streets intersect, such as the case at Ocean Park Boulevard and Lincoln Boulevard, and in higher activity areas like downtown, the maps show the expected \u201chot spots.\u201c", "As it pertains to traffic education and enforcement, the Santa Monica Police Department has maintained a balanced position on allocating resources to these identified areas, focusing in areas with higher concentrations of collisions.", "Primary Collision Factors", "Crash incident reports provide twenty-two options for categorizing the primary cause of the collision, Primary Collision Factors (PCF), selected by the officer taking the report. Options range from unsafe speed to right of way violations and falling asleep. The Santa Monica Police Department has been evaluating data in order to determine appropriate areas in which to dedicate resources. The purpose of such analytics is to ensure the Police Department is distributing efforts in the best possible manner. Overall, the Police Department citation issuance is on par with the appropriate primary collision factors in the impacted areas throughout the City of Santa Monica.", "As can be seen from year to year, the primary collision factors have rotated from Unsafe Speed/Inattentiveness to Unsafe Turning Movements. Those two primary collision factors account for a majority of all citations issued from year to year by the Police Department. Right of Way violations such as drivers/bicyclists failing to yield for pedestrians will continue to be an area of focus but the data set presents itself as a tertiary collision factor.", "Below is a snapshot of all traffic collisions and citations issued citywide from year to year:", "In the 2006-2016 SWITRS data, the top primary causes reported for all collisions resulting in fatal and severe injuries were:", "\u00b7 Violation of Pedestrian right of way (16%)", "\u00b7 Unsafe Speed (12%)", "\u00b7 Pedestrian Violation (12%)", "\u00b7 Violation of Automobile right of way (12%)", "\u00b7 Driving Under the Influence (10%)", "High vehicle speeds are especially concerning as they limit driver reaction time which limits the ability to avoid unexpected conditions or behaviors which do happen. Speed also increases the severity of injury when crashes do occur, especially for people outside of vehicles. In those cases, the chances of fatality from a crash at 30 miles per hour is 45% but at 20 miles per hour it drops to 5%.", "SWITRS records also indicate fault for each collision. For collisions involving a pedestrian, pedestrians were assigned fault in 22% of incidents and bicyclists were assigned fault in 42% of collisions involving a bicyclist.", "The Pedestrian Action Plan included a comprehensive analysis of ten years of crash data from 2001-2010. Consistent with findings from the Pedestrian Action Plan, recent crashes are occurring on the busiest streets, which have the most people as well as the highest speeds, and seniors continue to be disproportionately involved in the collisions. Santa Monica averaged 100 reported pedestrian-involved collisions a year during the evaluation period. Over the ten years of data, most pedestrians were walking legally in the right-of-way when they were hit by a vehicle. Other findings from this data analysis include:", "\u00b7 Seniors and young children are more susceptible to fatal and severe injury collisions both because of the higher likelihood they will be walking rather than driving, and because they are physically vulnerable.", "\u00b7 Two-thirds of the pedestrians involved in collision were in a crosswalk. Typically, when a pedestrian is at fault in a collision it is the result of crossing outside a crosswalk.", "\u00b7 50% of motorists who hit a pedestrian are proceeding straight, followed by making a left turn (22%) or a right turn (20%).

Many of these large and small cities have written and adopted a comprehensive Vision Zero strategy.", "Traffic safety is a value and priority of all Santa Monicans. Multiple City departments throughout the year strive to make the roads safe, encourage people to be alert, and educate the public about the rules of the road. Independently many departments work to achieve roadway safety by implementing departmental work plans. For instance, Public Works implements extensive annual street and sidewalk maintenance, repair and repaving, and maintains street lights.

PCD also maintains traffic signals, pedestrian signals, and roadway signs.", "The Santa Monica Police Department\u2019s Traffic Division has engaged in a variety of traffic education and enforcement operations. Efforts range from driving under the influence (DUI) checkpoints and saturation patrols, traffic enforcement operations, motorcycle safety operations, distracted driving, bicycle/pedestrian safety operations, public service announcements, social media, community meetings and interdepartmental collaboration. Officers conduct traffic safety presentations at WISE, local schools, and community events to provide traffic safety tips. The City also broadcasts via traditional and social media outlets a variety of public safety announcements on pedestrian safety, distracted driving, and other related topics. Traffic safety awareness messages are routinely posted on the Police Department\u2019s and City of Santa Monica\u2019s Facebook and Twitter pages. See Attachment B for details on Police Department enforcement, education and outreach and links to recent safety videos.

It was a fortuitous year, synchronized with opening of the Expo Light Rail and GoSaMo outreach, that encouraged and celebrated walking in Santa Monica. Whether you are one-year or one-hundred years old, walking is an activity done by everyone-- on two feet, with a walker, or in a wheelchair. From walking the dog, strolling on the beach or running to the corner store, walking provides the foundation of both the transportation system and much of the fabric of life in Santa Monica. Despite the fact that walking is a part of all trips, whether as the primary mode of travel or a way to get from a bus or car to the final destination, walking is often taken for granted.

Practices include how City departments approach their daily activities relative to pedestrians. Programs engage people to reduce the social and perceptual barriers to walking, and encourage more people to walk safely. Projects improve the infrastructure for walking, and the Project list is broken down into 5-, 10- and 15-year segments. To measure performance, the Plan recommends a biennial report card beginning in 2018 that measures progress toward Vision Zero, mode share of walk trips (as total trips, commute trips, and school trips), and progress on capital project construction. Progress on the first year of Pedestrian Action Plan implementation is described below in the three major action categories (see Attachment A for more details).", "Practices", "Changes to City practices address daily work habits, policies and priorities to increase the efficiency of implementing Pedestrian Action Plan recommendations.

In the 2016 Resident Travel Survey 43% of residents said that better infrastructure for walking and biking would encourage them to use those modes. Closing gaps in the network, especially near the I-10 bridges, completing the network of neighborhood greenways identified in the Bike Action Plan, and creating more physical protections for people on bikes are all possible approaches. Physically protected facilities provide barriers such as a curb, planter or parked car that provide a greater sense of comfort to people of varied ages and abilities. Barriers require reallocation of roadway space, such as changes to parking and vehicle travel lanes in instances where no other solution exists.

Achieving Carbon Neutrality will require creative thinking about how we travel. Changes in fuel alone cannot achieve the significant reductions needed. Today\u2019s infrastructure does not provide the attractive and comfortable conditions to entice enough new users. A virtuous cycle of safety has been shown in many studies \u2013 the more people walking and biking on the roadways, the lower the rate of collisions with motor vehicles. This pattern was already seen in Santa Monica since 2011, when the number of people biking increased overall but the rate of collisions with motor vehicles decreased.", "The resident travel survey shows that Santa Monicans are walking and biking in above-average numbers. But we are also driving short distances frequently with 62% of vehicle trips under three miles. These cold engine starts and short driving distances add to our emissions profile, and finding alternatives for some of these local trips will contribute substantially to achieving the goals of Carbon Neutrality. Making streets even more appealing to people outside a vehicle through protected and connected bike and pedestrian facilities, providing electrified first-last mile solutions that support transit use, and increasing the attractiveness of existing modes will be key.", "Autonomous Vehicles", "Of the approximately 35,000 annual fatal collisions nationwide, approximately 95% are due to driver error (National Highway Traffic Safety Association, 2016). Common nationwide issues are driver behaviors such as alcohol impairment, distracted driving and excessive speed. As a result, autonomous vehicles (AV) are often cited as a panacea for roadway safety. Also known as driverless vehicles, the vision is for vehicles capable of sensing their environment and navigating roads without human input. There is great enthusiasm in the marketplace for AV potential, leading many car and technology companies to partner on development and testing ventures.", "Enthusiasm for the potential of automation could eclipse the complex realities of human behavior on the road, unique roadway conditions typical for a community like Santa Monica, and long-term coexistence of both computer and human-controlled vehicles. AVs also have the potential to increase travel demand, which increases the exposure to crashes for all people on the road. Automation could also undermine the transit networks that move people most efficiently and safely.

This ordinance would help Santa Monica achieve the goal of becoming water self-sufficient by 2020 through limiting the city\u2019s water demand. The ordinance would not allow a new development to exceed the water use of the existing development on that property. If that requirement could not be met onsite, the excess water demand would have to be offset by reducing the water demand (through fixture replacement) at another site within the city. The water neutrality ordinance would require funding totaling $2,647,728 million over five years. Of that total, an initial appropriation of $2,272,123 would be required to prepare it for implementation. Of this total $2,089,749 would be completely recouped, through newly-established fees, as new developments are approved and completed. The remaining $557,979 would fund a technical design assistance program to help designers incorporate new and more water-efficient technologies to achieve compliance, software updates to administer the program, and initial costs to setup the program.

Council directed staff to prepare an ordinance that would require 1) new developments to stay within the same water use as the existing property through the installation of water-efficient fixtures and systems; 2) provide an In-lieu Fee option if compliance could not be met; and 3) provide a credit for affordable housing. Council also directed that implementation of an offsite retrofit program funded by In-lieu Fees be provided by City staff and/or a vendor.", "Discussion", "Over the last year and a half staff has convened regular meetings and solicited a significant amount of public input to assist with the development of this ordinance. Stakeholders have included the Water Neutrality Stakeholder Committee (Stakeholder Committee) which is comprised of representatives of water agencies, non-governmental organizations, sustainability consultants, architects, developers, manufacturers, engineers, plumbers, Los Angeles County; the City\u2019s Water Advisory Committee; and staff from the Public Works Department, Planning and Community Development Department, and the City Attorney\u2019s Office.", "Based on the input received from these groups, staff is recommending the proposed water neutrality ordinance (Attachment B) that would:", "1) Require new developments to be as water-efficient as possible through the design and installation of the most water-saving plumbing fixtures and/or non-potable water systems including graywater, rainwater harvesting, blackwater systems, and municipally supplied recycled/non-potable water (such as water from the Santa Monica Urban Runoff Recycling Facility (SMURRF)).", "2) If compliance cannot be met after all practical water-saving devices and systems are included in the design, the developer would be required to cover the costs to offset the water at an offsite location through the City\u2019s turn-key retrofit program and/or perform retrofits at self-selected sites at their own cost and risk.", "3) The City\u2019s initial turn-key retrofit program would include an Administration Fee and In-lieu Fee to cover the costs to implement and retrofit existing properties with water-saving toilets, urinals, showerheads, faucet aerators and/or other permanent water saving measures.", "4) Affordable housing would receive a credit. Instead of a 1:1 ratio for water offsets, 100% affordable housing new development projects would be required to meet a 0.5:1 offset ratio.", "5) Replace the Water Demand Mitigation Ordinance, effective March 1, 2018.", "Paths to Compliance", "Applicability - New Development", "Effective March 1, 2018, this ordinance would apply to new developments which include new buildings with plumbing fixtures; existing buildings with plumbing fixtures where 50% or more of the exterior walls or principal structural supports are demolished; and new or enlarged swimming pools, spas, water features, and ponds.", "This would not apply to a new garage that has no plumbing fixtures, a kitchen or bath remodel or an addition that does not require the removal of 50% or more of the exterior walls/structural supports.", "Recent data shows between 60 to 100 projects per year (with an average of 72) would be required to comply with the ordinance, including City projects. Seventy-six percent of these projects were single-family new developments. Since 2014, more than 150 new swimming pools were permitted.", "Building Design", "When a new development applicant applies for the initial building permit. Staff would notify the applicant of the water neutrality ordinance, as the entire design could be impacted by this requirement.", "The City would provide the applicant with the existing property\u2019s five-year average water use. This would be the baseline to compare projected new water demand. Where no water data is available, the baseline would be the five-year average of properties in the same customer class with the same meter size (example: single-family home with a one-inch meter). Five-years was chosen to reflect water use demands where varying occupancy, tenancy, and climate affects could be accounted for and averaged. Using only the most recent year or two could show a major shift in usage such as vacancy or severe water shortage restrictions, which would significantly impact the offset requirement. The baseline for water neutrality is completely separate from baselines used to establish water use allowances as part of the Water Shortage Response Plan.", "Staff is also recommending a new program to provide technical design assistance to help applicants achieve water neutrality. This was a specific request from the Stakeholder Committee to help designers select new technologies that they may not be aware of or have never specified in a project which would help them achieve compliance with the ordinance. The estimated $425,000 for five-years would pay for a consultant to review preliminary concepts and/or plans, provide recommendations for water-saving technologies, and direct the designer to additional resources and/or funding opportunities. Some technologies save both water and energy such as efficient showerheads, cooling towers, and recirculating hot water systems. The City\u2019s technical design assistance program would work in coordination with the existing Southern California Edison (SCE) and the Gas Company\u2019s Savings by Design Program, which, currently, tier 1 and tier 2 projects are required to utilize to achieve energy savings and receive financial incentives. The technologies recommended by both programs would be consistent for those products that save both water and energy. The SCE and Gas Company Savings by Design Program is funded by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC). City staff tried to expand upon the SCE and Gas Company to include water saving fixtures but they cannot add devices that only save water at this time due to CPUC regulations. Funding for the City\u2019s new technical design assistance program is included in the FY 2017-19 Proposed Operating Budget.", "Projected New Water Demand", "In order to standardize the projected water demand from a new development, a water demand calculator would be made available online to assist in the design of new developments and to show comparisons of projected water demand based on different plumbing fixtures, non-potable water systems, and landscaping choices. A water demand spreadsheet would be created by this calculator and would be used as part of the building plan set submission.", "The City and County of San Francisco has authorized the City to use its existing water demand calculator. Staff, in partnership with the Stakeholder Committee and the vendor selected to implement the offset program, would adapt this calculator to meet local conditions and current plumbing codes in Santa Monica.", "At the time of implementation, the calculator would provide sufficient data for the majority of new single-family and mixed-used development projects. The calculator would include the water use for toilets, urinals, showers, faucets, climate control systems, landscaping, pools, spas, water features, and ponds. Water benchmarking data, water usage data for specific types of water using devices for residents and businesses, is almost non-existent. Currently, the calculator is limited to water usage for only a few fixtures that have data such as toilets, urinals, and faucets. The calculator would evolve as more data becomes available for how much water various fixtures use in specific types of buildings, e.g. hair salon hair washing stations or restaurant dishwashers for a 30-seat capacity full service restaurant. In the future if a new full-service restaurant with 30 seats used the calculator, it would provide the projected demand for all the water using fixtures onsite such as for food-prep, thawing food, dishwashing, and cleaning in addition to toilets, urinals, and faucets.", "Plan Check", "Once developers decide on a final design, they would submit the new water demand spreadsheets to the Office of Sustainability and the Environment for review and approval. If a new development is designed to use no more water than the previous property\u2019s five-year average, the project\u2019s new water demand plan would be approved and no additional requirements would be applied.", "In-lieu Offsets", "If a new development is designed with all practical water-savings measures and additional water demand is still projected, the project would not be considered in compliance with the water neutrality regulations and would be required to offset the additional projected water use.", "Offsets would be achieved by retrofitting devices and plumbing fixtures like toilets, urinals, showerheads, and faucet aerators in an existing property located in Santa Monica. The number and type of retrofits would vary depending on the amount of water needed to offset each project. Developers would have the option of utilizing the City\u2019s turn-key retrofit program and/or performing their own retrofits. For developer retrofits, the City would require approval of the devices and their corresponding water savings estimates in addition to permits and inspections for those installations. For the City\u2019s program, toilets, showerheads, and faucet aerators would be installed initially and the City\u2019s vendor would be responsible for inviting owners of existing properties to participate in the retrofit program. The vendor would also pre-screen buildings to ensure they meet the criteria for retrofitting. The Stakeholder Committee recommended a priority installation list where low-income multi-family apartments would be asked to participate first followed by high-water use multi-family apartment then low-income single-family homes, etc. Multi-family properties are easy to retrofit and have more residents than individual single-family homes, thus generating higher water-savings.", "Most single-family homes are likely to achieve compliance by installing very water-efficient fixtures and landscaping on-site to meet existing building code requirements. These new developments would be more water-efficient than previous homes. However, installing a pool where one did not exist before or adding several new bathrooms as part of the new development project could require offsets somewhere else in the city.", "The proposed water neutrality ordinance is drafted to allow for flexibility in the design of water-efficient buildings in order to meet compliance. These are new technologies that may not be approved by the Los Angeles Department of Public Health and/or the State Water Resources Control Board at this time for installation in certain buildings such as graywater for toilet flushing in an apartment building. These agencies are developing a permitting process for a variety of new water-saving technologies and installation locations.", "Administrative and In-lieu Fees", "When an applicant is required to offset additional water use an Administrative Fee would be assessed. Additionally, if the applicant chooses to participate in the City\u2019s turn-key retrofit program an In-lieu Fee would be charged. The Administrative Fee covers the costs for administering the ordinance including coordination with the developer, maintenance of the projected water demand calculator, retrofit site selection, audits, inspections, data entry, and reporting. The In-lieu Fee covers the costs for the retrofit of water-saving fixtures elsewhere in the city. These two fees would cover the City\u2019s costs to implement this ordinance and would not be refundable. The fees are based on the costs charged by a vendor to implement the water neutrality ordinance.", "The amount of the In-lieu Fee would be based upon the cost to achieve the necessary water savings generated by replacing existing toilets, showerheads, and faucet aerators. This includes the cost of the replacement fixtures and the cost to install them. In order to calculate the water savings, certain assumptions would be made such as occupancy rate (numbers provided by the City\u2019s Planning Division), old and new fixture flow rates, duration of the flow or use, and per capita daily usage. The Stakeholder Committee agreed upon the formulas and assumptions included in the draft ordinance.", "A request for proposals was issued on December 16, 2016 for the administration and implementation of the in-lieu offset retrofit program. Two bids were received, however, both bids were incomplete and not reviewed. The request for proposals was re-issued on January 24, 2017. Two bids were received and evaluated by staff. The costs provided by the top ranking vendor was used as the basis for the Administrative Fee and In-lieu Fee (see Attachment C for In-lieu Fee). Retrofits performed by the City\u2019s vendor are subject to prevailing wage requirements.", "On July 11, 2017, staff will bring to Council a request to authorize negotiations with the top ranking vendor. Staff will also request for Council to set the plan check fee, inspection fee, the Administrative Fee, and the In-lieu Fee related to this ordinance as part of the annual fee schedule update on June 27, 2017.", "The Administrative Fee would be a flat rate of $2,000 per project to be paid at the time of the building permit issuance. This Administrative Fee covers the cost of the vendor to help City staff implement this ordinance and it includes coordination with staff, the developer, maintaining the calculator, selecting and pre-screening the retrofit sites, verifying developer retrofits, reporting, and City prevailing wage reporting. The vendor could also provide plan check and inspection services if needed.

The modifications to this ordinance presented for Council consideration would significantly reduce environmental impacts related to runoff and promote a stronger shift towards sustainability in land use design and in local water resource management. Specifically, the recommended changes would keep stormwater, a water pollution source, out of the Santa Monica Bay (Bay) and implement new requirements associated with the 2012 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permit. The modified Ordinance also includes new language for more effective and comprehensive oversight to reduce urban runoff pollution associated with trash containment, water feature discharges, equipment maintenance, and surface parking areas for existing properties, known as good housekeeping practices to protect the Bay.", "Background", "In 1972 the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) was created in Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. \"NPDES prohibits [discharges] of pollutants from any point source into the nation's waters except as allowed under an NPDES permit.\" The program gives the EPA the authority to regulate discharges into the nation's waters by setting limits on the effluent that can be introduced into a body of water from an operating and permitted facility.", "In 1987 Congress also passed the Water Quality Act, which called for increased monitoring and assessing of water bodies to ensure that water quality standards were not just on paper, but were actually being realized in the nation's waters. The EPA authorized the NPDES permit program to state, tribal, and territorial governments, enabling themto perform many of the permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects of the NPDES program themselves. Currently 46 states, including California through the State Water Resources Control Board and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards are authorized to implement the NPDES program.", "In 1990, regulations for discharges from a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) for the NDPES permit were finalized by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (Board), and the first 5-year NPDES permit was issued to Los Angeles County. The goal was to reduce runoff pollution entering the waters of the United States through basic water pollution control practices, such as street sweeping, catch basin cleaning, hazardous waste facility inspection, and public education, which the City was doing in part.", "In 1992, in a forward-thinking move to go beyond the basic requirements of the first NPDES permit, the City established SMMC 7.10 to control runoff pollution associated with dry weather runoff, wet weather (stormwater), construction site activities, and daily activities on existing parcels (good house-keeping practices). This ordinance helped the City comply with the 1990 NPDES permit, as well as meet the goals of the City\u2019s Sustainable City Plan regarding natural resources and pollution reduction.", "In 1996, the second NPDES permit was adopted by the Board with no major changes.", "In late 2000, with the expected approval of the third NPDES Permit, SMMC 7.10 was updated to incorporate a new requirement of the third NPDES permit, which was adopted in early 2001 - increasing the rainfall collection numerical standard of onsite, structural post-construction Best Management Practice.", "In 2007, the fourth NPDES permit was approved by the Board.

The 2012 permit significantly expanded the scope of stormwater management by requiring onsite harvesting, treatment, and use of precipitation before it otherwise runs off to the municipal storm drain system and drains into the Bay, carrying numerous pollutants and resulting in violations of various Clean Water Act standards. This was a shift from the previous regional strategy of stormwater treatment and release to Santa Monica Bay. Prior to the 2012 updates, the City\u2019s existing Ordinance focused on onsite harvesting and minimized the emphasis on treat and release, resulting in minimal change to the management strategy within the Ordinance. After adoption of the 2012 NPDES permit, cities were given a multi-year timetable to develop Enhanced Watershed Management Plans (EWMPs).  EWMPs are comprehensive watershed plans and hydrology analyses that comply with the permit requirements.  These were submitted to the Board for its approval in 2016. The City, working with its watershed municipal partners, such as Los Angeles, complied with all deadlines.", "Discussion", "The proposed modifications to the Urban Runoff Pollution Control Ordinance update the requirements for new and re-development projects to install post-construction structural devices to collect stormwater for treatment and use, keeping pollutants out of the Santa Monica Bay and promoting local water use and conservation.

The City of Santa Monica Wellbeing Index also identified that \u201cspending time outdoors, whether exercising or relaxing brings both emotional and physical benefits. Santa Monica\u2019s parks provide clear opportunities for community members to thrive by providing places for residents to recreate, meet friends and be active. For many of our residents who live in multi-family housing, the City\u2019s parks and the beach are their front and back yards. Based upon the 2016 Los Angeles Countywide Parks Needs Assessment, Santa Monica has 1.4 acres of parkland/1000 residents which is well below the countywide average of 3.3 acres for every1000 residents.", "While expanding park acreage in Santa Monica is desired, future funding for parks expansion and for upgrades to existing parks will be very limited due to budget realities, hampering the ability to implement a number of the projects that Council has already funded for design. Therefore, it is timely to explore a possible local funding measure for the November 2018 ballot. In order to assess voter opinions regarding a local parks funding measure, staff recommends a contract modification in the amount of $51,350 for the City\u2019s contracted survey research firm, Goodwin Simon Strategic Research to complete up to two telephone surveys to assess resident support. Additionally, staff has selected TBWB Strategies to provide strategic advisory services for a potential bond measure at a cost of $78,000 which is within the City Manager\u2019s budget authority.", "Background", "Santa Monica has a long history of investing in its parks, beach and recreational facilities as supported by both the Parks and Recreation Master Plan (Attachment A) and the City\u2019s Open Space Element (Attachment B). Santa Monica\u2019s first Parks and Recreation Master Plan, completed in 1997, was intended to guide improvements of the City\u2019s parks and recreational facilities for twenty years. The plan recognized that these improvements would add to the livability of the City and would build a sense of community by creating opportunities for physical, social and cultural interaction. Since 1997, the City has increased its park acreage from 112.7 acres to 137 acres, providing a range of places and amenities for community members to exercise, experience nature, socialize with others, participate in cultural events and enjoy the outdoors, helping people thrive, stay healthy and build community. In addition to increasing park acreage, existing park and beach facilities have been improved over the past two decades resulting in upgraded amenities and new features that address emerging trends.  Historically, funding for these improvements has come from a variety of sources including the City\u2019s General Fund; City Enterprise funds (i.e. Beach Fund); Santa Monica Redevelopment Agency funds; grants from County, State and Federal government sources; private donations and a range of development fees assessed through the Municipal Code and as part of negotiated Development Agreements .  These funding sources alone will not be sufficient to fulfill the future park needs of Santa Monica reducing the City\u2019s ability to close the gap between the current park acreage as it relates to the City\u2019s population (1.4 acres for every1000 residents) and the countywide average of parkland (3.3 acres for every1000 residents).", "In November, 2016 Los Angeles County voters supported the passage of the Safe, Clean, Neighborhood Parks and Beaches ballot measure (Measure A) by more than the 2/3 super majority required. As a parcel tax, it will provide direct funding to Santa Monica on a per capita basis for parks improvements beginning in July, 2018. It is estimated by the County that Santa Monica will receive approximately $10 million over a 10-year period as well as be eligible for competitive grant funds. This funding, while beneficial, will not be sufficient for the projects Santa Monica envisions.", "In November 2016, Santa Monica voters also approved Santa Monica College Measure V supporting capital improvements at SMC as well as several joint use projects in Santa Monica and Malibu including up to $20 million in bond funds for the expansion of Memorial Park to accommodate soccer and/or other field sports for use by College students and the general public. It is contemplated that these funds would need to be supplemented by additional funding to achieve a full upgrade and transformation of Memorial Park inclusive of redesign of the recreation buildings to better meet community needs.", "At the State level two similar park funding bills are being considered for the June 2018 ballot. AB18 the California Clean Water, Climate and Coastal Protection and Outdoor Access for All Act of 2018 would authorize the issuance of $3 billion in General Obligation bonds for a variety of open space improvements throughout the state including local park improvements. Similarly, SB5, the California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection and Outdoor Access For All Act of 2018 would also authorize the issuance of $3 billion in General Obligation bonds for open space improvements. At this time there is no certainty that either of these bills will be signed by the Governor and advance to the June 2018 ballot. With assistance from the City\u2019s lobbyist staff will continue to monitor these potential measures.", "Discussion", "While park maintenance and operations funding is an important consideration, the most significant shortfall is in capital funding to acquire, design and construct additional parks and park facilities. With the 2012 elimination of the Santa Monica Redevelopment Agency, the City lost a major source of funding for capital improvement projects. The remaining sources of funding as described in the Background section above are insufficient to fund major park expansion or renovation projects. A preliminary list of projects that could be supported through a local capital funding measure include:", "\u00b7  The 12-acre expansion of Airport Park which currently has funding for design only;", "\u00b7  A permanent sports field in the Civic Center with subterranean parking to offset the loss of existing surface parking;", "\u00b7  Implementation of a full renovation of Memorial Park;", "\u00b7  Planning for the transformation of the Airport to park land following its closure;", "Identification of potential joint use opportunities with School District as well as land acquisition and park development opportunities for future park expansion in underserved neighborhoods", "A general obligation (GO) bond, which would require approval by two thirds of the voters, would provide the most capital funding at once for parks in Santa Monica. Other methods to create a local funding source, which would still require a financing mechanism such as a lease revenue bond to generate funding up front, would require voter-approved increases to City tax rates to pay for the annual debt service. Additional consideration would need to be given to funding streams for operating costs into the future. Community support for a GO Bond or other funding mechanism can be gauged through polling. The recommended poll would survey 600 Santa Monica voters. The poll could gauge voter preferences regarding the use of the new City proceeds for parks. For example, a poll could test whether voters find that new parks and open space or improvements to existing parks, cultural services or some other use to be most compelling.

The Ring lawsuit against the City was resolved through a Settlement Agreement, which included the City\u2019s acquisition of the Park in December 2000. In addition to settling the lawsuits, the City\u2019s acquisition created opportunities to preserve affordable housing and develop a plan for needed infrastructure improvements at the Park.

The primary variables that impact the financial assistance associated with long-term viability include:", "1. Minimal rent increases subject to the Rent Control Board annual general adjustment.", "Vacancy de-control is not applicable to mobile home parks, therefore rents cannot be increased to market rate after a vacancy. Maximum annual rent increases at the Park are limited to the Rent Control Board annual general adjustment, which has averaged one percent per year over the past five years. The financial viability of the Park will be stressed if operating expenses outpace rental revenue increases.", "2. Property tax burden once the Park transitions to private ownership.", "Under City ownership, the Park is exempt from property taxes. Upon transfer, the Park owner would receive property tax abatement only for spaces occupied by tenants certified as low-income households. Obtaining appropriate household income documentation will be crucial to achieving the necessary tax exemption and maintaining the financial viability of the Park.", "3. Placing new homes on vacant spaces to stabilize Park revenue, including resolving use of vacant spaces containing existing encroachments.", "The net annual loss for the Park between fiscal years 2013-14 and 2015-16 averaged $92,000. The Park is currently generating revenue from 81 out of the available 105 spaces due to vacancies. Of the 24 vacant spaces, 13 spaces are available for immediate use. The maximum allowable space rent in the Park is currently $378 per month. Leasing the 13 spaces, projected within two years of transfer, would generate approximately $59,000 in additional annual revenue, leaving a continued operating gap.", "Resolving the issues associated with the 11 spaces compromised by encroachment from adjacent mobile homes would further enhance operating revenue, strengthening the financial viability of the Park.", "4. City\u2019s commitment to fund reserve accounts.", "The Park is currently not generating sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and may need a one-time capitalized operating reserve at transition to fortify the Park\u2019s financial capacity until vacant and encumbered spaces are occupied with new homes over time.", "5. Capital improvements", "Park residents have expressed an interest in improvements to the community building for gatherings and community-building activities. Funding for upgrades to the community building would also enhance the marketability of vacant spaces.", "In 2009, the City completed a $5 million infrastructure project to underground electrical, telephone, and cable television lines; improve natural gas, potable water, sanitary sewer, and street-lighting systems; and upgrade curb, gutter, and roadway pavement surfaces. The City recently completed an expansion of the pool deck, replacement of the pool fence, and installation of a pool lift for persons living with disabilities.", "6. Restricted household income level of future households.", "All three proposals model Park occupancy assuming home ownership on the existing vacant spaces. Whether the new tenants can afford to purchase and install new manufactured homes depends on the desired target population for the vacant spaces. New manufactured homes are estimated to range in cost from $55,000 to $75,000. A household with incomes at the lowest end of the spectrum would need a 100 percent subsidy to purchase a new manufactured home, while a very low-income household would need the majority of the cost subsidized. A low- or moderate-income household would likely not need a subsidy to purchase a new manufactured home.", "7. City\u2019s commitment to fund a homeowner program for existing renters of City-owned manufactured homes. None of the proposals project long-term viability without programs to help renters become owners.", "As owner of the 29 rental homes, the City is currently responsible for expenses related to regular maintenance and repairs of the homes. Furthermore, the financial burden of upkeep compounds as the homes age and would continue to strain the Park\u2019s financial viability. These factors result in atypical operating expenses for the Park when compared with tradition mobile-home parks occupied entirely by homeowners, who are responsible for the maintenance and repairs of their homes.", "Negotiating Parameters", "The Park must maintain long-term financial viability, provide quality property management and resident engagement, sustain affordable rents pursuant to housing covenants and the Rent Control Law, and minimize the investment of limited housing funds. As a result, staff recommends that the Council adopt parameters to guide the negotiations with a selected proposer. Recommended parameters for the disposition agreements include:", "1. Develop a long-term financial operating plan that reflects the housing-affordability covenants and rent-control restrictions associated with the property and ensure sufficient annual budgets to support quality property management and resident services, while minimizing housing-trust-fund assistance that is necessary to support long-term viability;", "2.

Include a detailed strategy to encourage mobile-home renters to become owners, including financial impacts associated with the strategy;", "4. Include a plan with financial contingencies for renters who choose not to become owners;", "5. Include a cost-effective plan to finance common-area improvements (e.g., clubhouse, lighting, fencing) over the short-term and long-term, including incorporation of the City\u2019s sustainability initiatives;", "6. Include a plan for occupancy of vacant spaces that respects the City\u2019s policy for addressing vacancies (i.e. existing residents may maintain encroachments until they leave voluntarily or otherwise give up the encroachment voluntarily) while incorporating the City\u2019s sustainability initiatives;", "7. Include a plan for new occupancy of vacant spaces to incorporate a mix of affordability levels;", "8. Include a provision to ensure that the City\u2019s long-term interests are maintained, such as a City option to repurchase the property at the end of the affordability covenant term.", "9. Include a plan for addressing property-tax expenses, including obtaining income-qualification information from existing residents, as well as funding property taxes in cases where income qualifications cannot be met.", "On-going Property Management", "The scope of property management duties that RECS currently performs covers all necessary routine functions, including: handling day-to-day operations; supervision and coordination of maintenance and repair contracts; payment of all operating expenses such as utilities, maintenance, repairs and fees; occupancy responsibilities, including leasing and rent collection.

The proposals received in response to the RFP, and recommendation from the Committee and Commission, show that transferring the Park in a manner that meets the City\u2019s expectations would require significant negotiations, development of detailed long-term plans, and final Council approval. Therefore, staff recommends extending the existing property management contract with RECS for an additional twelve months through June 2018, to ensure continued management until proposed deal terms can be approved by Council and the transfer completed. The current contract expires on June 30, 2017.", "Alternative", "Council could select a transferee and authorize the City Manager to negotiate and execute final transfer documents pursuant to Council-adopted parameters.  However, the opportunity for public review and Council approval of specific terms such as affordability levels and total city investment would be missed. Council could also reject all proposals and direct staff to conduct a new RFP process, which staff does not believe would result in different outcomes.

The appellant\u2019s first point is to assert that the restaurant could impact the price and accessibility of the hotel to working people as a limited amenity to the hotel. The restaurant is being operated by a separate and distinct entity from the hotel and is not permitted to be a hotel amenity. Further, the CUP is only being requested for alcohol service in conjunction with restaurant operations. Condition #8 requires the separation of hotel and restaurant operations and therefore, the proposed restaurant is no more an amenity of the hotel than any other nearby restaurant.", "2. The appellant\u2019s second point states that the Shore Hotel has outstanding violations with respect to their existing Conditional Use Permits. Notwithstanding that the Shore Hotel and the applicant\u2019s request for an alcohol CUP in Space B are unrelated, the Code Compliance Division has previously investigated the Shore Hotel\u2019s possible violations of existing CUPs and determined that the hotel is in compliance. The applicant making the request for the proposed alcohol CUP for Space B is not associated with the ownership of the Shore Hotel. Further the restaurant is being operated separate and distinct from hotel operations.", "3. The appellant\u2019s third point states that pending litigation between the Shore Hotel and the Coastal Commission should be resolved prior to approving a CUP for Space B. City staff contacted Coastal Commission representatives staff regarding the pending litigation and was informed that the pending litigation should not impact the CUP for  alcohol service by a third party applicant in Space B. Staff was also informed that the trail trial is currently scheduled for June, 2017.  As previously mentioned, the applicant requesting the alcohol CUP for Space B is not an affiliate to the Shore Hotel ownership. The restaurant in Space B is being operated separately from the hotel and would be required to obtain separate approvals from the Coastal Commission prior to commencing operations.", "4. The appellant\u2019s fourth point contends that CUP Finding #3 (parcel is physically suitable for the proposed use) cannot be met because the hotel and restaurant will not operate as separate entities. This particular finding addresses the physical suitability of the parcel for the proposed use. The tenant space where the restaurant with alcohol service is proposed is on the ground floor of the hotel building with frontage on 2nd Street. The tenant space has a pedestrian entrance on 2nd Street and is suitable for accommodating the proposed restaurant use with alcohol service. The appellant\u2019s contention that the hotel and restaurant will not operate as separate entities cannot be substantiated. The City has received no evidence that the restaurant will operate as anything but a separate tenant of the hotel. In addition, as noted above, conditions of approval have been included to ensure that the hotel and restaurant operate as separate entities.", "5. The appellant\u2019s fifth point contends that CUP Finding #4 (compatibility with on-site uses) cannot be met because the hotel is in litigation with the Coastal Commission over its Coastal Development Permit and is unsure if the hotel will continue to operate. As noted in the response to the appellant\u2019s third point of appeal, City staff contacted Coastal Commission representatives regarding the subject application for a CUP for alcohol service in Space B and was informed that the pending litigation would not preclude the approval of a CUP for the proposed restaurant in Space B by a third party applicant. As previously mentioned, the applicant requesting the alcohol CUP for Space B is unrelated to the operation or ownership of the Shore Hotel. Furthermore, the issuance of the CUP would not alter the respective positions of the Coastal Commission or the Shore Hotel in the pending litigation. Even if the litigation were to result in a termination of hotel operations, such termination would remain a private matter as between the Shore Hotel (as landlord) and the CUP applicant (as tenant). Furthermore, the restaurant in Space B is being operated separately from the hotel and would be required to obtain separate approvals from the Coastal Commission prior to commencing operations.", "6. The appellant\u2019s sixth point states that Conditions #2 and #3 allow for more seats and extended hours of alcohol service than the previously approved CUP for the subject space (Space B) and those hours for Blue Plate Taco (Space A). The request for a CUP for alcohol service in Space B is a new application that does not rely on previous approvals. In recommending the hours of alcohol service, staff reviewed the approved alcohol service hours for other Downtown restaurants in addition to assessing proximity of residential land uses that could be impacted by alcohol service at the restaurant. Based on the primarily commercial land uses in the immediate surroundings and recently approved alcohol service hours, the 7AM-2AM limitation was approved by the Planning Commission.", "7. The appellant\u2019s seventh point states that Condition #5 provides a loophole for room service by the hotel. This condition permits the restaurant to deliver food \u201cto go\u201d to the rooms as they may to any other off-site location and is not related to amenities offered by the hotel.", "8.  The appellant\u2019s eighth point states that Condition #8 does little to prevent the restaurant as a hotel amenity. This condition requires that the hotel and restaurant must operate separately by expressly stating that the CUP terminates with termination of the restaurant\u2019s operations by the applicant or any approved successors. Any successor operator of the restaurant must provide the Director of Planning evidence to substantiate (i) that it is legally separate and distinct from the owners of the Shore Hotel and (ii) that its operation at 1530 2nd Street will be separate and distinct from the Shore Hotel.", "9. The appellant\u2019s ninth point states that Condition #9, which requires a compliance report on the restaurant\u2019s conformance with the CUP conditions, will not lead to successful enforcement given the prior allegations of CUP violations by the hotel. Condition #9 only addresses the restaurant\u2019s compliance with the alcohol CUP conditions of approval and does not involve the hotel operator at all. Compliance with the alcohol CUP conditions of approval is the responsibility of the restaurant operator.", "Applicant\u2019s Statement", "The applicant has provided, as requested by the City Attorney, legal documentation to demonstrate their operation as a separate and distinct entity from the Shore Hotel ownership.

The property owner filed a timely appeal on December 13, 2013 contending that the Landmarks Commission wrongly designated the building as a City Landmark and the property as a Landmark Parcel. While the appeal was still pending before the City Council, a new court decision concluded that the proactive designation process used for this property might be legally problematic because it may not comport with due process requirements. Subsequent to this development in case law, the property owner submitted materials to supplement the previously-filed appeal. On November 1, 2016, City Council upheld the appeal, in part as to certain procedural matters, and remanded the pending Landmark designation application back to the Landmarks Commission. The City Council\u2019s decision did not result in a substantive disapproval of the application. Indeed, the City Council did not consider whether the property met the criteria for designation.", "The Landmarks Commission, consisting of a quorum of four Commissioners who were appointed after the initial designation hearing on December 9, 2013, held a Public Hearing on the Landmark Designation application on February 13, 2017.

Included with this material is a Landmark Assessment report prepared by the property owner\u2019s historic consultant that concludes that the property is not eligible for designation.  Additional attachments were received from Mr. Diamond that are to voluminous to recopy but are available for public review in the Planning Division.", "At the hearing, the Commission heard testimony from two members of the public that endorsed the designation of the building and parcel, noting the significance of its integrated artwork which represents the combined vision of businessman Howard Ahmanson and artist Millard Sheets. An audio excerpt of an interview with Millard Sheets was also introduced in the public record by the property owner\u2019s representative in which Mr. Sheets described the mosaic at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as \u201csatisfactory and also expressed his reservations about the overall size and level of integration of the mosaic on the primary elevation of the building.", "During deliberation, members of the Commission discussed the significance of the former Home Savings and Loan Bank building and its associated artwork within the context of Santa Monica\u2019s history; recognized the significance of Millard Sheets; identified the building as having a significant presence and a representation of Santa Monica\u2019s history. Some members expressed concern about the alterations that had occurred to the building, particularly the changes to the west elevation that had diminished the design symmetry, but ultimately concluded that the building retained sufficient physical integrity and was still able to visually convey its historic significance. Members also acknowledged the personal criticism of the mural expressed by its artist Millard Sheets, but further noted that the artwork is still distinctive and well-known throughout the greater Santa Monica community. One Commissioner expressed opposition to the building\u2019s designation, noting that the building offers very little architectural merit, and that the only potential items of merit are some of the art pieces.", "A motion to designate the property under five of the six criteria (#s 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) was moved and seconded. Although three of the four members of the Commission present at the public hearing on February 13, 2017 voted to designate the building and parcel at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel based on four of the six designation criteria, a technical denial resulted because a motion to designate the subject building and parcel as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel failed to receive four votes in the affirmative as required by the Landmarks Commission\u2019s Rules of Order for substantive matters.

In its statement, the appellant concludes that the designation of the subject building as a City Landmark was overwhelmingly supported by the evidence presented in the public record, including the City\u2019s staff report and historic consultant report, local preservation experts, and by a majority of the Commission members present during the public hearing. The appellant believes that the one dissenting vote cast during the public hearing, which resulted in the technical denial, was arbitrary and subjective, and did not fully take into account the evidence that was presented in support of designation. Finally, the appellant contends that had Staff, in the written and oral staff reports, indicated to the four Commissioners present during the public hearing that a unanimous vote would be required for designation, a different outcome may have resulted.", "Appeal Analysis", "The Council, in its de novo review of this appeal, is being asked to determine whether the proposed project meets the findings required for Landmark designation identified in SMMC Section 9.56.100. The Council may uphold the appeal or uphold the decision of the Landmarks Commission, in whole or in part, based upon these findings. As noted above the appellant has identified three points for overturning the Landmarks Commission\u2019s decision. Each statement and staff\u2019s analysis is provided below.", "1. The designation of the subject building as a City Landmark is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence presented in the public record.", "The appellant\u2019s conclusion concerning the preponderance of evidence in support of the designation of the former Home Savings building at 2600 Wilshire Boulevard included as part of the public record on the matter, is accurate. The City\u2019s historic consultant, Historic Resources Group (HRG), was asked to consider the subject property relative to the Landmark Designation criteria and provide its independent analysis and recommendation in the form of a written report for Landmarks Commission consideration. This report, which was prepared specifically for the remanded hearing and independent of the prior analysis conducted by the City, is included as Attachment E.  This report concludes that the subject property meets five of the six Landmark Designation criteria as specified in the City\u2019s Landmarks Ordinance, and provides detailed recommended findings to support its conclusion. Additionally, the Staff Report that was prepared for the Landmarks Commission concurs with HRG\u2019s recommendation for designation based on five of the six criteria.", "Correspondence and testimony from the general public was also received in advance and during the public hearing, including written letters and emails from individuals who have backgrounds and interest in historic preservation. This correspondence supported the designation of the property as a City Landmark. The Commission was also in receipt of written correspondence from the property owner\u2019s legal representative which recommended against designation. Although much of this correspondence generally challenged the procedural legalities of this particular designation application, and the manner and procedures in which it was processed, reviewed and acted upon, a Landmark assessment report, prepared by the property owner\u2019s historic consultant, was included with this material that concluded that the property did not appear to meet any of the City\u2019s Landmark Designation criteria. Staff believes that there was enough evidence in the record to support the Landmark designation and that such a designation could withstand given the evidence in the record.", "2. The dissenting vote, which resulted in the technical denial, was arbitrary and subjective, and did not fully take into account the evidence that was presented in support of designation.", "The City\u2019s Landmark and Historic District Ordinance (Santa Monica Municipal Code Chapter 9.56) formally establishes a seven-member Landmarks Commission as a quasi-judicial, discretionary body, whose membership is appointed by the City Council. This Ordinance delegates certain power and authority to this Landmarks Commission to advance historic preservation goals throughout the City, including the power to designate a structure, improvement, natural feature or object as a Landmark based on qualifying criteria. SMMC Section 9.56.100 describes the Landmark designation criteria. When conducting a Landmarks designation hearing, the Landmarks Commission is asked to determine whether based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the property meets one or more of the criteria set forth in SMMC 9.56.100. In doing so, individual Commissioners exercise their independent judgment when applying the evidence to the criteria.", "During the February 13, 2017 hearing on the matter of the Landmark Designation application for the former Home Savings building only four Commissioners were able to be seated for the public hearing. On a motion to designate the building and site as a Landmark and Landmark Parcel, one Commissioner, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, determined that the property did not meet any criteria in SMMC 9.56.100. This Commissioner was presented with all the same information as the rest of the Commissioners present at the hearing, clearly articulating their opinion that the former Home Savings building is monolithic in appearance and brutal in its approach, and lacked any architectural merit. This Commissioner further suggested that the only items of potential merit would be the art pieces, specifically the sculptures. This vote was not arbitrary and unsubstantiated. This Commissioner stated his opinion for the record that the building lacked architectural merit and could not make the required findings, but that there may be historic significance to certain features found on the property (i.e. some of the artwork) as described in all of the reports and testimony. However, since the motion offered was for the designation of the building and site in its entirety as a City Landmark and Landmark Parcel, this Commissioner did not support the motion as presented.", "3. If staff had indicated in written and oral staff reports to the Landmarks Commission that a unanimous vote would be required for Landmarks designation, a different outcome may have resulted.", "The Landmarks Commission has adopted Rules of Order to inform the Commission on its protocol and conduct while carrying out Commission business. These Rules provide specific guidance that require a vote of at least four members to carry out substantive matters, without exception (Rule 2). The approval of a Landmark Designation is a substantive matter. Although the circumstances and prior history of this specific designation application is complex and unusual, there isn\u2019t a noted exception to allow the designation of a Landmark to occur without a vote of four members in support regardless of the number of Commissioners present to hear a matter. Although in hindsight, staff accepts that this fact could have been reiterated in its Staff Report, staff believes the fact that it wasn\u2019t has no bearing on the expressed opinions of the individual Commissioners.", "Conclusion", "From the onset, the model for the construction of Home Savings branches, as dictated by owner Howard Ahmanson, was to instill public trust and confidence in the banking institution and still reflect traditional family and community values. This was achieved through marrying art and architecture with building design. Each aspect was integral to creating a unique and cohesive design that was indicative of the Home Savings brand and model. In addition, the building, with its clean lines and lack of ornamentation, acts as a frame that allows the artwork to standout prominently, particularly the mural.", "It has been stated that other extant examples in the region are architecturally superior (the original prototype branch located in Beverly Hills) and/or exhibit a higher level of historic integrity (the Anaheim branch, which is nearly identical) than the Santa Monica building. While these may better reflect the ideals and imagery that is representative of the former Home Savings of America, the City has no jurisdiction or ability to exert any protections over these outlying buildings. The City of Santa Monica has one extant former Home Savings and it is the City Council\u2019s charge to determine if this specific resource tells a distinct story reflective of Santa Monica\u2019s unique history based upon the criteria described in SMMC Section 9.56.100 of the Landmarks Ordinance.", "In applying the City\u2019s significance criteria for individual recognition as a proposed City of Santa Monica Landmark, the staff believes that the building meets the threshold for Landmark designation based on five of the City\u2019s designation criteria. Therefore, staff recommends that the City Council grant the appeal and designate the former Home Savings building as a City Landmark and the subject property as a Landmark Parcel based upon the findings required by SMMC Section 9.56.100:", "(1) It exemplifies, symbolizes, or manifests elements of the cultural, social, economic, political or architectural history of the City.", "The property symbolizes a period of Santa Monica\u2019s postwar architectural history. Specifically, the property is an example of postwar bank architecture and is one of only two examples of a Home Savings and Loan branch office with a modified v-shaped, projecting-wing building plan designed by artist Millard Sheets in collaboration with architect S. David Underwood. The building was constructed in a period of rapid expansion and growth for the Home Savings and Loan Association. The monumental massing, formal symmetrical fa\u00e7ade arrangements, high quality materials and integrated artwork, including one of the largest mosaic murals commissioned by Home Savings, is representative of the Home Savings building program that resulted in some of the most iconic and recognizable buildings in Southern California. Although there have been some minor alterations, the integrity of the structure remains high in terms of location, design, setting, workmanship, feeling, and association. Further, the character-defining features on the building exterior and site remain intact including:", "\u00b7 Plaza paved in exposed-aggregate concrete", "\u00b7 Circular, tiered planter with bronze sculpture", "\u00b7 Wide, raised terrace with a battered masonry wall, integral raised planters, and wide concrete steps", "\u00b7 Two-story volume and symmetrical composition", "\u00b7 V-shaped plan", "\u00b7 Complex massing consisting of a tall, high volume central pavilion with a hexagonal plan, flanked by lower two-story volume wings with rectangular plans", "\u00b7 Flat roofs with low parapets", "\u00b7 Exterior walls clad in travertine slabs", "\u00b7 Continuous friezes of textured ceramic tile, bordered by travertine fillets", "\u00b7 Clusters of fixed, metal-framed, vertical strip windows with wide travertine mullions", "\u00b7 Large stained-glass window on the east fa\u00e7ade", "\u00b7 Floor-to-ceiling, fixed glass panels with metal frames at primary entrance", "\u00b7 Mosaic tile mural directly above the primary entrance", "\u00b7 Secondary entrance from the parking lot with a pair of fully-glazed metal doors with sidelights, and concrete steps with battered masonry cheek walls", "\u00b7 Wall-mounted bronze sculpture", "Although the Home Savings branches built during the postwar era had similar qualities to maintain design continuity, the Santa Monica location is distinguished by the orientation of the building to the street corner and the works of art that reference the local Santa Monica beach culture.", "(2) It has aesthetic or artistic interest or value, or other noteworthy interest or value.", "The property includes examples of artwork which are unique to the Santa Monica location and are distinguished by their size and arrangement on the projecting-wing building plan. The most prominent work is the 40-foot wide mosaic mural on the primary fa\u00e7ade depicting local themes including swimming, yachting, fishing, and beach games. The themes established in the mosaic influenced the remainder of the artwork on the property including a plaza fountain topped by a bronze sculpture of a family at play in the surf. Another bronze sculpture of a child with dolphin decorates the east-facing fa\u00e7ade along with a stained-glass window that was intended to give a kaleidoscope of beach activity depicting swimming, beach games, and figures with animals located on the south elevation. The size of the mosaic mural represents a departure from the Millard Sheets\u2019 traditional aesthetic of smaller vignettes across a field of darker material. As such, the property has aesthetic and artistic value because not only is the mural an unusual example of large-scale artwork within the Home Savings building program, but the projecting-wing building plan was also atypical and is a distinctive feature of the property. While other branch buildings were characterized by building wings that usually project from the secondary fa\u00e7ade creating elongated rectangular plans, the Santa Monica branch incorporates the familiar Home Savings design elements integrated with a modified v-plan and plaza that makes the subject property noteworthy, and as such, it also possesses artistic and aesthetic value.", "(4) It embodies distinguishing architectural characteristics valuable to a study of a period, style, method of construction, or the use of indigenous materials or craftsmanship, or is a unique or rare example of an architectural design, detail or historical type valuable to such a study.", "The Santa Monica Home Savings Building is an excellent local example of the postwar building program set forth by the Home Savings and Loan Association. During the 1950s to 1970s, Home Savings embarked on an ambitious building program that started with the completion of the 1956 branch office in Beverly Hills. Public reaction was so positive that instead of expansion through acquisition, Howard Ahmanson, founder of Home Savings and Loan Association, decided expansion would occur through construction of new branch offices in high-demand areas. The building designs came to represent Home Savings\u2019 corporate identity with continuity in its readily-identifiable monumental form, cladding, fenestration, and location-specific artwork. The Santa Monica branch is unique in terms of its high volume central pavilion with projecting wings resulting in a distinctive, modified v-shaped plan. The Santa Monica Home Saving Building is one of only two known examples of this type (the other was constructed in Anaheim) and is therefore the only example of its kind in Los Angeles County.", "(5) It is a significant or a representative example of the work or product of a notable builder, designer or architect.", "The building was designed by Millard Sheets, who was a prominent Southern California artist, in collaboration with architect S. David Underwood. Sheets\u2019 use of integrated artwork in his commercial building designs attracted the attention of Howard Ahmanson who commissioned him to design a series of branch offices for Home Savings. The branch offices of the Home Savings and Loan Association represented the introduction of integrated artwork into the commercial aesthetic with links to local culture through references to location-specific themes and motifs. The monumental massing, formal symmetrical fa\u00e7ade arrangements, high quality materials and integrated artwork came to define Home Savings\u2019 corporate identity making the branch offices instantly recognizable. Over his nearly thirty-year involvement with Home Savings, Sheets designed over forty branch locations in California including new construction, renovations, and the installation of artwork in temporary locations.", "(6) It has a unique location, a singular physical characteristic, or is an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, community or the City.", "The Santa Monica branch of the Home Savings and Loan Association is readily-identifiable by its monumental form and aesthetic, and situated on the parcel with its primary volume and entrance oriented at a 45-degree angle to a prominent corner street (west primary fa\u00e7ade).

The amendment pertained to Phase Two Development on the north and south campuses of the Health Center campus. In the originally-proposed amendment, Providence sought an extension of the expiration dates for each of the eight Development Review Permits submitted for Phase Two. The amendment was to allow development in five phases over an approximately twenty-three year period. Providence made this request because it is unable to construct the entire Phase Two Project within the timeframes currently provided by the Development Agreement. Providence also stated that this amendment is necessary because it must maintain current Health Center operations and provide required parking through the duration of Phase Two construction. The amendment would allow Providence to focus on elements identified as programmatic priorities and necessary components for orderly build out of the Phase Two Project in the near-term, while having assurance that longer-term future development at the Health Center can occur in response to changing community health care needs.", "As part of the City\u2019s preliminary review of Providence\u2019s proposed Development Agreement amendment, several key issues were identified for further discussion during the Planning Commission and Council float-up/concept hearings.

However, most concert-goers flock to the beach, which has become a regional destination on Thursday evenings. Crowd sizes have increased further since last year\u2019s arrival of the Expo line. For 2016, public safety staff estimated beach-crowd-size averages of between 15,000 and 20,000 people each week. The elimination of the jumbotron has not deterred attendance. Since most beach-goers are far from the speakers, which have remained, and many are unable to hear the music, staff assumes that many attendees are there mainly to enjoy an evening with friends on the beach. The efforts to book emerging talent have also not been effective at reducing attendance since bands that may be unknown when booked, may become popular by the time of the series. In addition, for many attendees, the band does not matter as they are there for the festive, evening beach experience.", "The designation of beach lanes and quadrants has helped with public safety; however, the large crowds on the beach continue to challenge public safety personnel and require the assistance of the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department, as well as allied agencies, to fully staff each concert. Traffic within the entire downtown area is severely affected, to the point that last year, the Big Blue Bus was forced to re-route bus service along Fourth Street and to run a shuttle to transfer passengers. The beach is overwhelmed with trash and significant resources are required to clean up the beach after each concert, which defers regular summer beach maintenance. Although more portable restrooms were added in 2016, it is very difficult to provide a sufficient number to accommodate the large crowds. The portable restrooms need to be removed from the beach after each concert and set up the following week by Beach Maintenance staff.

Kansas Avenue has on-street parking on both sides, and serves as the back of house for some commercial developments along Pico Boulevard. Most of the surrounding development is multifamily residential.", "Kansas Avenue Mid-Block", "The proposed curb extensions and crosswalk on Kansas Avenue are in response to the school campus pedestrian access changes and not a prior adopted plan. The proposed crosswalk will better align with the school\u2019s new rear entrance gate which was relocated during the school\u2019s reconstruction. The school entrance is adjacent to an existing speed hump. Rather than remove the speed hump, the new six-inch raised crosswalk is proposed to integrate the new speed hump. Pedestrians would cross on a flat level surface at the same grade as the raised public sidewalk. This speed table crosswalk is similar in concept to the crosswalk constructed in front of City Hall across Main Street. Vehicular passenger loading is also proposed to be consolidated into a 78-foot loading zone on the north side of Kansas Avenue, east of the proposed crosswalk. No net parking will be eliminated to create this crosswalk, because the consolidation of loading zones creates spaces which compensate for any removal for the crosswalk. This project was not funded by the Caltrans grant given the timing of the school\u2019s redevelopment but can be added to the project scope and locally funded by the Transportation Impact Fee.", "3) Kansas Avenue/27th Street", "At this T-intersection located east of Virginia Avenue, two curb extensions, associated curb ramps, two painted crosswalks, and regrading to remove runnel channels are proposed.", "Kansas Avenue and 27th Street", "A traffic circle was initially proposed by MANGo at this location. After a land survey was complete, it was found that there was insufficient space (less than 20 feet between proposed curbs) to accommodate a traffic circle due to the narrow width of Kansas Avenue. It was determined that pedestrian crossing could be improved by providing curb extensions instead. An additional crosswalk across Kansas is supported by SMMUSD staff and is proposed to allow a crossing alternative to the Stewart Street/Kansas Avenue intersection. This new crosswalk will require the elimination of one on street parking space in order to add red curbing for visibility.", "Re-grading this intersection will also allow the removal of the concrete runnel drainage channels that cross 27th Street where it intersects with Kansas Avenue. This will remove a cycling hazard from along the MANGo route.", "4) Stewart Street/Kansas Avenue", "This four-way stop controlled intersection would receive curb extensions and dual curb ramps on three corners of the intersection (except the southwest corner), landscaping and irrigation, painted crosswalks, and painted yellow centerlines. The southwest corner will receive a painted curb and concrete neck down in an effort to avoid impacting the County of Los Angeles storm drain. This location is directly on the MANGo route.", "Kansas Avenue and Stewart Street", "The MANGo plan identified curb extensions and enhanced crosswalks at Stewart Street and Kansas Avenue. This location is heavily traveled by school children and parents in the morning and afternoon and is a busy location for automobiles traveling to and from schools and homes in the area, and north-south traffic. A crossing guard is located at this intersection during the morning and afternoon school commute.", "The City\u2019s Department of Public Works was concerned that the proposed curb extensions would prohibit a trash truck from turning right onto Kansas Avenue from Stewart Street southbound. This is a travel route for the Resource, Recovery and Recycling (RRR) division\u2019s collection services. Computer generated turning tests demonstrated that the City\u2019s trash truck and Hazmat fire apparatus, which has a more limited turning radius, would be able to make the turn. A follow up field test was undertaken which confirmed early results. The exercise provided some insight into some design changes that would improve vehicle circulation such as increasing the radius of the northwestern curb extension to 20 feet, painting yellow centerlines on each leg of the intersection and adjusting the location of where vehicles are designated to stop on Kansas Avenue. The most significant constraint at this location is the narrow width of Kansas Avenue which requires vehicles to follow the trash truck as it serves Kansas Avenue, an existing condition.", "It was also suggested that narrowing each Stewart Street approach could increase congestion by eliminating the ability to use the wide travel lane (and adjacent bike path of travel) as two lanes, one for through vehicles and one for right turning vehicles. This narrowing will re-enforce the intended one-vehicle per approach operation and prohibit right turns from occurring simultaneously with through traffic. While this may require some to wait longer to make a right turn, it will provide considerable safety benefits to active transportation users by reducing right-of-way confusion, reducing conflicts with pedestrians, and prohibiting vehicles from blocking the existing northbound bike lane.", "5) Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue", "The Bike Action Plan (BAP) proposed a median refuge island/diverter on Pico Boulevard/30th Street as a crossing enhancement. This alteration would involve completion of the median at the 30th Street intersection and providing two narrow channels (breaks in the median) for cyclists to cross with a separated resting place in the center of Pico Boulevard. The refuge median would include rolled curbing which allows passage of emergency vehicles but would prohibit passenger vehicles from crossing Pico and making left turns from and to Pico Boulevard.", "The BAP identified the Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue location as a key location for improving north-south bicycle access because it links to parts of the bike network that provide lower-stress routes. This location would be one of two marked crossing points between 28th Street and 33rd Street, the other being a crosswalk with Rapid Rectangular Flashing Beacons and signage located at 31st Street. This crossing would make connections to the Dorchester Tunnel and destinations towards the north like Ishihara Park and Expo light rail and bike path. The intersection is home to two bus stops, one on the southwest corner and another on the northeast corner of the intersection. Median Diverters are a common neighborhood treatment in locations where lower volume streets cross higher volume streets. They are intended to make it easier to cross major boulevards by allowing two-stage bike and pedestrian crossing and discouraging through traffic from using neighborhood streets. The design process looked at multiple options, including some which preserved passenger vehicle turns. However, none of these options improved the protection or safety of people crossing, which is the primary goal of this improvement.", "At the second Community Open House, a number of residents and businesses expressed concern about the implications of restricting left turns from Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue, and restricting vehicle through traffic across Pico Boulevard. The concerns included reducing access options to residents and businesses, and how the turning restrictions would alter traffic patterns. A traffic analysis was completed to understand vehicle displacement if the median were completed.", "The traffic analysis forecasts that vehicle displacement would be relatively small given the number of vehicles that are currently making these turns. For example, 29th Street between Pico Boulevard and Pearl Street, where the greatest increase is possible, could see an increase from 1,633 to 1,804 vehicles over a 24-hour period, and Urban Avenue between Pico Boulevard and Pico Place, could see an increase of 165 vehicles over the course of a 24-hour period (171 vehicles). If the assumption is made that the additional traffic is distributed between 7AM and 7PM each day that is approximately 14 additional vehicles per hour. Typically, a change of this size is small enough to be imperceptible to people living on a street like 29th Street. Similar traffic increases are also possible at Yorkshire Avenue and 31st Street. The study made the assumption that traffic would be distributed to the nearest adjacent street, knowing that some will elect to use 28th Street to utilize the existing traffic signal at Pico Boulevard. While this project has the potential to adjust the way people drive to and from the neighborhood, the safety improvements at 30th Street and Pico Boulevard would provide significant benefits to neighborhood walking, biking and mobility.", "It is apparent that the outreach efforts have successfully reached a segment of the community that may be impacted by the change and more time is needed for the City to communicate with those residents and businesses. Staff is proposing to delay this project location to allow for additional outreach and evaluation of options which will require these improvements proceed on a separate, decelerated track. Staff would return to Council at the time of construction bid approval for the other changes for final approval of an approach to improving crossing at this location. The Caltrans grant funds included crossing improvements at this intersection.", "CEQA Determination", "Section 15301 of CEQA Guidelines provides Class 1 exemption for the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency's determination. Projects that fall into this class (Class 1) include alterations to existing streets, sidewalks, gutter, bicycle facilities, and other similar facilities and additions of safety or health protection during for use in conjunction with existing facilities. The project consists of the construction of curb cuts and extensions, ramps/diverters, crosswalk striping, pavement striping, and wayfinding markings on existing streets, sidewalks, and intersections near Edison Language Academy and Pico Neighborhood. No changes to operation (including expansion of roadway capacity) are proposed. Therefore, this project is a Class 1 project that is categorically exempt per Section 15301 of the CEQA Guidelines. Furthermore, none of the exceptions specified in Section 15300.2 of CEQA Guidelines would apply that would preclude the use of these CEQA exemptions - The project site is not located in a sensitive environment, the project will not have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances, the project would not damage scenic resources, the project would not be located on a hazardous waste site; and the project would not cause a change to a historical resource.", "Next Steps", "The next step is to complete the construction drawings for Delaware Avenue/22nd Street, Kansas Avenue Mid-block near school, 27th Street/Kansas Avenue, and Stewart Street/Kansas Avenue. Additional outreach to residents and businesses potentially impacted by the changes proposed at Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue will be completed. This will be followed by construction bidding and consultant selection. Staff will return to Council with recommendations on the construction contract and the final Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue design.", "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions", "There is no immediate financial impact or budget action necessary as a result of recommended action. Staff will return to Council when specific budget actions are required. It is anticipated that construction costs will be covered by the grant which is budgeted in the 2016-18 CIP with some additional funding from the Transportation Impact Fee account to cover the cost of the added Mid-block crosswalk on Kansas Avenue and eventually for ADA upgrades and lighting at the Pico Boulevard/30th Street/Dorchester Avenue intersection. Construction of these added project elements is contingent upon future Council budget approval.", "No additional funds are requested for the completion of construction plans.

For purposes of the discussion, we assumed an 8-10 year lifespan for the temporary sports field. Coastal Commission staff indicated pursuant to the California Coastal Act, in evaluating projects they are responsible for considering whether the project creates an adverse impact to public access to the beach for recreational purposes. Additionally, they expressed concerns regarding mitigating the loss of parking and made it clear that any required mitigation would need to be implemented to coincide with the construction of the temporary field and that it would not be acceptable to delay mitigation of the loss of parking to a future permanent solution.

The analysis would need to evaluate parking utilization in the Civic Center surface parking lot, Civic Center parking structure, nearby beach parking lots, and nearby on-street parking by time of day and day of week over the proposed use period, and would need to analyze to what extent the removal of 600+ spaces would impact public access to the beach. The analysis would consider relevant aspects of Downtown parking utilization that could reasonably affect the Civic Center, but not necessarily all Downtown parking resources. Coastal Commission staff indicated the study would need to consider uses in the area as well as the impacts on the timing of decisions made regarding the future repurposing of the Civic Auditorium, and would expect the study to factor in all alternative modes of transportation including Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plans for all uses.", "While Coastal Commission staff indicated their willingness to keep an open mind, they cautioned that a loss of parking that impacts beach access \u2013 even if labeled as temporary \u2013 could impact the timing for other improvements in the area and especially the repurposing of the Civic Auditorium. Lack of adequate parking availability could potentially preclude new activity, leaving the Civic dormant for many years in the future. They expressed reservations regarding allowing a use with this level of parking impact to commence without imposing requirements to offset or mitigate impacts to beach access, acknowledging that in their experience temporary uses can often become long-term given constituent support for them once in place. Further, Coastal Commission staff indicated they would also want to consider how to guarantee construction of permanent subterranean parking if a temporary field is constructed.

If the bond measure were to fall short, the funds necessary to design the field will have been risked. Both options would increase field maintenance and operational costs for the City at a time when the City\u2019s five year financial forecast is showing a growing structural deficit. While both options present risks, the permanent field with parking below would be optimal for meeting the needs of the current uses in the area as well as the future use of the Civic Auditorium while providing a permanent solution for the multi-purpose field for use by SAMOHI teams and the general public as contemplated by the Civic Center Specific Plan.", "Staff recommends that Council provide direction to continue discussions with SMMUSD staff on terms of a potential partnership.

Bloomberg saw the potential to apply this to the wellbeing of the whole community and all its residents.", "The challenge to be solved starts with the reality that local government generally lacks critical data to measure our contribution and apply that data to systematically improve lives and our shared sense of community.", "By applying leading edge practices to local governance, the City of Santa Monica proposed to create a new tool - the Local Wellbeing Index - that would help us genuinely understand trends, needs, and challenges faced by the people we serve. This concept of using data to understand people and drive change evolved over time thanks to lessons learned through our pioneering efforts to protect the environment, preserve affordable housing, address homelessness with compassion, and do whatever it takes to help our children succeed. Development of this new Wellbeing Index was guided by an international panel of experts to pare the emerging interdisciplinary research of wellbeing with the practicalities of local government.", "The five dimensions of civic wellbeing defined below offer a foundation for a proposed framework. (Please see Attachment A: Wellbeing Framework)", "\u25cf Community: Often described as \u201csocial capital,\u201d a community with strong connections among its inhabitants can flourish in good times and withstand the tough ones. How strong is the sense of community and connection in Santa Monica?", "\u25cf Place: The characteristics of the area in which people live\u2014physical, social, environmental and economic\u2014affect how wellbeing is fostered and supported. Does Santa Monica\u2019s physical and social environment promote/support wellbeing?", "\u25cf Learning: Education is linked to virtually all wellbeing outcomes, but even beyond measures of high school or college graduations, lifelong learning in and out of the classroom is a key factor of wellbeing. Do people have the opportunity to enrich their knowledge across the lifespan?", "\u25cf Health: Being and feeling healthy\u2014or at least having the tools and resources needed to manage any health challenges\u2014are essential to an overall sense of wellbeing. How healthy is Santa Monica?", "\u25cf Economic Opportunity: Economic conditions, including opportunities for upward mobility, are key to creating a community in which a diverse population can live and thrive. Is Santa Monica a place in which a diverse population can live and thrive?", "Staff have begun inventorying core municipal services throughout the organization and mapping work efforts to a primary dimension. This work, which will continue over the next few months, will also fully integrate with environmental sustainability and good governance.

Yet the City of Santa Monica does not have a Council-adopted overall vision or mission statement, nor a strategic plan. (It does have a motto that presages the concept of civic wellbeing: Populus felix in urbe felice, loosely translated as \u201cHappy people in a happy city.\u201d).", "In 1994 Council adopted Santa Monica\u2019s first Sustainable City Plan which identified organizational and community-wide sustainability goals for the environment, local economy and community quality of life, and established metrics to track progress toward meeting those goals. In 2003 that plan was significantly expanded following a 15 month community process that resulted in the current plan that includes nine goal areas focusing on Resource Conservation, Environmental and Public Health, Economic Development, Housing, Open Space and Land Use, Transportation, Community Education and Civic Participation, Human Dignity, and Arts and Culture.", "Last summer, Council assessed a dozen major initiatives then underway and chose five Strategic Goals. Those top priorities (none of which were new efforts although each involved a refocusing on tangible long-term outcomes), are listed below.

While Santa Monica\u2019s foundation of wellbeing and sustainability is unique, cities often cite economic health, environmental health, accessibility, safety, and livability as key outcomes.", "An interdepartmental team comprised of representatives from the Finance Department, Office of Civic Wellbeing, Department of Public Works, and City Manager\u2019s Office plus the leads of the five Strategic Goals, who were the first employees to map and align work efforts within the framework, are leading the development of the framework and evolution of the City\u2019s performance management system. On January 10, the City\u2019s Leadership Team of Department Heads and Division Managers, plus Budget Analysts, convened to learn about the Wellbeing Index, its dimensions, and how the framework will be incorporated into the Biennial Budget. About a week later, on January 18, the same group of staff re-convened to learn how other cities have used organizational frameworks as the foundation of their performance management systems and began to map key daily municipal services and operations within the proposed framework. (Please see Attachment B: Workshop Photos) Over the next few months, staff will continue to map their operations. As the framework is meant to be a comprehensive and living tool, able to capture the City\u2019s dynamic work, changes and additions will be made throughout the budget cycle.", "How well are we succeeding? How can we both improve services and achieve better results?", "It\u2019s important to know what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, how well it should be done, get regular feedback about results, and work collectively to improve. More simply, that means asking and answering the questions \u201cWhat are we trying to do?\u201d, \u201cHow well are we doing it?\u201d, and \u201cHow can we be more effective?\u201d That\u2019s performance management.", "We are certainly not alone in focusing on measuring and managing performance. It is nearly universal in the private sector. Student achievement testing has exerted a profound impact on public education and foundations and funders are increasingly insisting non-profits measure and manage their outcomes.", "Cities across the country have developed innovative and iterative models to measure and manage performance. The CompStat model that originated in police agencies in Boston, New York and Los Angeles has had wide influence in law enforcement. CityStat in Baltimore applied performance measurement and management to a wider range of municipal services and has also been widely embraced by innovative city governments. There are now sophisticated data visualization portals to capture and convey goals and outcomes. Baltimore, Boston, Louisville and Los Angeles each have municipal performance management programs and associated, including web sites that serve as \u201cdashboards\u201d or \u201cscoreboards\u201d to publicly report results.", "Locally, Santa Monica\u2019s Sustainable City Plan and Sustainable City Report Card have been used as models by numerous cities throughout the U.S. as they developed and implemented similar performance management systems. Since 2012, Santa Monica\u2019s Cradle to Career Initiative has established cross departmental and interagency projects to improve outcomes for kindergarten readiness and teen mental health. Since 2014, over 35 cities have requested guidance on how to implement a local government wellbeing framework to guide performance management and outcome-oriented governance. Towards that end, Santa Monica has been asked by Bloomberg Philanthropies to co-sponsor a convening of twelve pilot cities across the United States to begin replication of the wellbeing framework and index work.", "The process of measuring and managing performance starts with defining clear, meaningful and measurable objectives and targets about what we want to achieve. For example, progress towards an affordable and diverse community may be gauged through increasing the number of deed-restricted affordable housing in Santa Monica. One way to tell how well the community is thriving may be the number of Santa Monica residents who feel that they can count on their neighbors. These are metrics for some of our Strategic Goals. We will also create meaningful and measurable goals and metrics for day-to-day City operations.", "Once the goals are set, data will be captured, analyzed and shared. By looking at data, we can see if we are making progress towards our intended outcomes or figure out a new approach. We\u2019ll make decisions or recommendations based on what we\u2019ve learned. And, being clear about what we want to achieve as well as our actual achievements helps everyone know how they contribute. Plus, we can show our results to the community and celebrate successes.", "It should be emphasized that while we are being more systematic and comprehensive in this effort, we are certainly not starting from scratch. Our Police Department uses performance management to track, solve and prevent crime. Our Big Blue Bus uses \u201ckey performance indicators\u201d (a widely used term in the private sector) to manage on-time performance and other results. Every department uses data and metrics in day-to-day management. What we are building, however, is a citywide culture and comprehensive approach to measure what matters most and make it transparent to the community. That is the future of local public sector accountability.", "The next steps in the evolution of our performance management practices include creating a coherent path forward, working with departments on mapping operations to existing and proposed dimensions, defining key terms, finding examples from other cities as well as from within the organization, identifying \u201cearly adopters\u201d or pilots, building staff teams, and securing the resources needed to successfully implement a performance management system. The City\u2019s new Chief Performance Officer, who will soon be joined by the City\u2019s first Chief Data Officer, the Office of Civic Wellbeing, and the Finance Department will spearhead this.", "How does what we do influence civic wellbeing and sustainability?", "Cities must leverage all of the data they routinely collect about residents, services, and programs in order to establish policy recommendations, develop programs, and gauge their impact. Every City plan or policy is informed by stakeholder input, which may come through formal and informal planning processes, surveys and data collection, stakeholder meetings, Boards, Commissions, and Task Forces, neighborhood associations, comments to the Council, social media, and other avenues.", "While Santa Monica already uses a diversity of data sources to understand community needs and the efficacy of programs and services, creating a framework and evolving our performance management system creates an opportunity to collect and use data in a more focused manner. Future feedback and data points will be viewed and evaluated within the context of the City\u2019s framework.", "Next steps and measures of success", "This organizational evolution starts by developing a cohesive framework that is meaningful to community, Council, and staff. With a framework in place, we can align programs and services to specific dimensions and demonstrate how Council priorities and municipal operations further organizational goals. Staff has already begun mapping work to the wellbeing dimensions and creating metrics, first with the Strategic Goals. For example, investing in a new homeless multidisciplinary street team that can provide field-based medical, mental health, substance abuse, and housing placement services to a specific group of 25 historically high-users of emergency services is a pro-active way to address how homelessness impacts the quality and access of shared and community spaces, or place. We will use data from multiple sources to assess if this intervention reduces the number of arrests, citations, field interviews, and use of emergency medical services by the cohort as well as the cost-effectiveness of the model.", "The FY 2017-19 budget will begin to transition the way the City communicates about its programs and services.

Outcome-based budgeting, or performance-based budgeting, aligns budgetary decisions with the achievement of large-scale outcomes. In recent years, cities such as Richmond, VA, Baltimore, MD, and Lincoln, NE have adopted outcome-based budgeting strategies, as well as over 45% of state governments. This approach focuses on the use of long-range budgeting to ensure that budget priorities and requests connect with the achievement of policy outcomes. Developing a framework will allow the Santa Monica to develop a budget that includes detailed metrics which will showcase the work of departments in achieving major outcomes for the residents of the city.", "Like all sustainable changes in organizational culture, building a comprehensive performance management system in Santa Monica will be an incremental process which will take a number of years. Nor does it operate in isolation from complimentary efforts to align budget with performance (\u201cperformance budgeting\u201d); greater investment in training and workforce skill development; pursuing data-driven decision-making; and investing in the technology and workspaces that support these efforts.", "Creating and using a framework will help City staff see how their work advances a citywide strategy and know what is expected of them.

The bike box is a type of advance stop line that directs vehicles to stop well short of the cross walk at an intersection, creating an open space (or box) between themselves and the cross walk. This allows bicycles to move into the open space at the front of the queue during the red signal phase, making them more visible, allowing them to correctly position themselves for turning movements and clearing the curb lane for vehicles turning right. The bike box, in addition to correctly positioning the cyclists at the front of the queue, is an advantage for pedestrians since it provides a buffer between vehicles and pedestrians crossing the street. Construction drawings were then developed for these five intersections with selected bicycle detection and bike box designs for each based on best fit of treatment with existing infrastructure and bicycle activity. These drawings were later refined in summer of 2016 by City staff to incorporate striping changes at Broadway and 11th, Michigan and Lincoln Blvd, and Ocean Ave and California, three of the five intersections selected for the study.

However, staff does not agree with the appellant\u2019s appeal statement for the following reasons:", "1. The appellant\u2019s first point concerns that the findings were subjective and not relative to who is directly impacted and therefore not justified. Staff contends that the project meets all of the required findings for a Variance as provided in Attachment A. The property\u2019s existing conditions with respect to parcel slope result in the building\u2019s practical first floor to be considered a second floor and likewise, the second floor to be considered a third floor level, which creates a special circumstance with respect to how building design on the site relates to the applicability of the Zoning Ordinance. The conditions of approval restricting the size and location of the rear balcony created an unnecessary hardship that is more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and result in an unreasonable deprivation of the use of the property as compared to the other properties in the neighborhood.", "2. The appellant\u2019s second point contends there are design-related issues resulting from removal of the roof mass encompassing the sides of the existing deck. Replacement with the requested balcony railings would only further impact the adjacent neighbors. In deciding to the approve the Variance, the Planning Commission reviewed the proposed balcony and found that the removal of the roof massing to accommodate for the balcony expansion would actually reduce the massing at the rear elevation of the residence, therefore making the residence appear less dominating. The 126 square foot balcony will remain within the mass of the existing residence and will be set back 3 feet from the sides of the existing residence. The balcony will serve to permit outdoor activity that does not offer considerable visual access to adjacent private yards, thereby mitigating potentially detrimental impacts on adjacent neighbors. In addition, since the balcony is accessed from the master bedroom, it is unlikely to be a location where significant social activities will occur.", "3. The appellant\u2019s third point concerns the findings made in relation to height, massing, and pedestrian orientation. The existing height of the residence and deck expansion, if granted, would dominate over adjacent neighbor\u2019s backyards. Staff contends that the existing height of the residence would actually appear less dominant due to the removal of the roof massing as indicated above. Further, staff believes the proposed balcony extension would not materially change the existing development on the site and would not be visible from the street. The prevailing street character will remain unchanged and the existing single-family residence would continue to be compatible in size and function to the surrounding residential neighborhood.", "4. Lastly, the appellant\u2019s fourth point concerns the size of the expansion greatly and adversely impacts and lessens the adjacent neighbor\u2019s privacy. Staff contends that restricting the existing third floor balcony beyond 24 square feet would limit the property owner\u2019s use and enjoyment of their property and causing the subject property to be unreasonably deprived compared with other properties in the immediate neighborhood that have larger size balconies located in the rear yard. The third floor balcony expansion is consistent with the prevailing characteristic of the neighborhood with approximately 32 of the 63 lots (51%) within an approximate 300 foot radius of the subject site have decks or balconies at the upper floor or roof deck level. Furthermore, staff believes due to the relatively small size of the approved balcony and its location from an upper-level master bedroom, the balcony does not have a natural propensity towards group activities that may generate higher noise levels than similar neighboring properties with balconies located in the rear yard and accessible from living areas within a residence. The third floor balcony is also significantly smaller in area than what would be permitted by code (360 square feet) and will be setback 17 feet from the rear property line and well within the required 4 foot side yard setbacks.", "As detailed in the project and appeal analysis, there are special circumstances surrounding the proposed project and the subject site that warrant the support of the Variance request to extend the balcony. In summary, the site is a sloping lot, which establishes a special circumstance where the technical third story requires the consideration of a Variance. Furthermore, balconies are viewed by the Zoning Ordinance as building projections and not a part of the building volume that would otherwise be subject to the minimum setback requirements.", "While the consideration of the Variance request allows the decision-maker the discretion to take into account impacts to the neighborhood, the conditions of approval restricting the size and location of the rear balcony created an unnecessary hardship that is more restrictive than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, and result in an unreasonable deprivation of the use of the property as compared to the other properties in the neighborhood, as evidenced by the other third story additions and existing sizeable roof decks and rear balconies.", "As proposed, the size and the location of the balcony complies with the setback and building volume envelope requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and would not grant any special rights to the property owner nor excessively impede upon the privacy of adjacency lots in any way that goes beyond the rights expressly granted by the Zoning Ordinance. The proposed balcony extension would not materially change the existing development on the site and would not be visible from the street. The prevailing street character will remain unchanged and the existing single-family residence would continue to be compatible in size and function to the surrounding residential neighborhood. Requiring the property owner to comply with the conditions of approval from the previously approved Variance imposes a hardship that prevents the applicant from utilizing the property in substantially the same way that neighboring properties are, or could be, utilized.", "Community Outreach", "The applicant has informed staff that significant neighborhood outreach has been conducted on their part by personally contacting each owner and resident along the 100 block of Fraser and Ocean Park Boulevard to explain and describe the project scope.", "Alternatives", "As an alternative to the staff recommendation, the Council may consider the following with respect to the pending appeals if supported by the full evidentiary record:", "1.

Small, accessory structures, including a solar port, RRR enclosures and bike lockers, are also proposed on the site.", "The proposed project includes the removal of some original building components: 1) an exterior stairwell on the building\u2019s north wing; and 2) the rear 37 feet of the south wing, which originally housed the City\u2019s Fire Department and specifically the firetruck bays. The eastern building walls that will be adjacent to the CSB wing will remain but a total of seven windows (one on the south wing and six on the north wing) would be removed and filled in to create a 3-hour fire wall together with the walls of the new structure. The windows to be removed are not original; they are compatible \u201cin-kind\u201d replacements installed in the original openings that were revealed when the police building was removed.", "Another minor alteration to City Hall\u2019s exterior is the conversion of one window at the eastern end of the south fa\u00e7ade of City Hall to an egress door for fire exit requirements. The existing historic sash and frame will be removed, the sill will be cut down to floor level, and a new door assembly will be installed. The replacement of one existing window with a new door will be a minor alteration on a secondary fa\u00e7ade and will have minimal visual and material impact on the building\u2019s historic integrity.", "The proposed new building, which would be clearly differentiated from the historic building, would be higher than the adjacent second floor parapet but lower than the front of City Hall and its cupola.", "Analysis of Potential Historic Resource Impacts", "Historic Resources Group (HRG) prepared a Historic Resources Technical Report (Appendix A of Attachment E) assessing the proposed project for consistency with each of the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s Standards for Rehabilitation (the Standards). In analyzing the proposed demolition and modifications to City Hall, HRG examined whether these alterations would result in new impacts to a historic resource that the CCSP EIR did not consider and would substantially reduce the integrity or significance of the resource. To make this determination, the proposed alterations were reviewed in the context of several relevant Preservation Briefs and for consistency with the Standards. Each proposed alteration is described and analyzed to determine whether it might impact the stability or integrity of the historic structure or parcel. The report also looked at whether the alterations taken together might cause the resource to lose its eligibility as a State or National historic landmark.", "HRG\u2019s conclusion that the proposed demolition \u201cwill not substantially reduce the integrity or significance of important resources on the site or in the vicinity\u201d is based on the determination that the original building components proposed for removal are located in the rear of the building, are not the most important character-defining features and that their removal will leave the majority of character-defining spaces and features of City Hall substantially intact. For these reasons, after removal of these two components, City Hall will retain sufficient integrity to convey its historic significance and remain eligible for listing on the California State Register and the National Register of Historic Places.", "The HRG study also concluded that the overall setting of City Hall would not be substantially altered by the project and that \u201cthe overall historic integrity of City Hall will be retained\u2026 The majority of the character defining features of the City Hall property will remain intact and will continue to convey their historic significance.\u201d The proposed new construction was also reviewed to determine if it would result in cultural resource impacts that would be substantially greater than those analyzed in the CCSP EIR. Analysis of the new building includes the relationship of the addition to the primary, Landmark building, and its effect on the historic courtyard of City Hall, which was returned in 2005 to a state more closely resembling the period of significance. The courtyard will transform from a 3-sided landscaped area of 8,000 square feet to a 4-sided (enclosed) area of 6,500 square feet. The current landscaping, designed to evoke the original circular driveway behind City Hall, is not original or character-defining. In consideration of the full historic resource analysis, the CCSP EIR addendum concludes that the project would not result in new impacts that would be substantially greater than those analyzed in the CCSP EIR.", "Planning Commission Action and Appeal", "On November 2, 2016, the Planning Commission held a public hearing and considered the Development Review Permit (DRP) application for the proposed City Services Building and a recommendation to amend the CCSP. At the Planning Commission hearing, concerns were expressed regarding the project\u2019s impact on the historic setting of City Hall. The Commission was particularly concerned with views of City Hall\u2019s primary fa\u00e7ade that would be impacted by the proposed solar port structure in the north parking lot, which would supply some of the solar energy necessary to achieve a net zero energy building. The hearing was continued to November 16, 2016, to allow time for the applicant to evaluate potential project revisions including reducing the size of the solar carport and pulling it back from Main Street to retain the view of City Hall from the Main Street Bridge, and minimizing the amount of equipment in the north parking lot. The applicant was also asked to provide clarification to the Commission on certain components of the project including views from Olympic Drive and other alternatives for the equipment and solar panels that were considered.  After additional testimony and presentation by representatives of the Public Works Department (the applicant) and members of the public, the Planning Commission approved the DRP by a vote of 4-2, with one abstention. The Planning Commission also adopted a resolution recommending that the Council amend the Civic Center Specific Plan (CCSP) in order to change the project location within the City Hall site and increase its height, along with an addendum to the CCSP Environmental Impact Report. The specific plan amendment request is being forwarded to Council as a separate hearing item on this agenda.", "On November 29, 2016, the Planning Commission\u2019s approval of Development Review Permit 16ENT-0140 was appealed in a timely manner by David Garden.

The project provides Community Benefits consistent with Chapter 9.23.", "In his appeal statement (Attachment C), the appellant challenged the following findings and conditions contained in the Planning Commission\u2019s Statement of Official Action: Findings A, C, D, G, and Conditions of Approval Nos. 6, 15 and 17. However, staff does not agree with the appellant\u2019s appeal statement and the following discussion summarizes and provides staff\u2019s analysis of each of the appeal points.", "Finding A Appeal Summary", "In approving the DRP, the Commission found that:", "The physical location, size, massing, setbacks, pedestrian orientation, and placement of proposed structures on the site and the location of proposed uses within the project are consistent with applicable standards and are both compatible and relate harmoniously to surrounding sites and neighborhoods in that the project is located in the Civic Core section of the Civic Center Specific Plan area, complies with the CCSP development standards, and is a public building that is part of the CCSP's program to provide government offices necessary to serve the City's community.", "(Note: the Finding is based on an assumption of Council approval of the recommended CCSP amendment.)", "The appellant states that he is \u201cconcerned that the proposed \"massing\" overhangs the historic City Hall building on the south side as it projects all the way to the sidewalk and disturbs the historically significant streetscape view of City Hall from Main Street.\u201d He requests that other building massing options be considered, including options that would be taller but on a smaller footprint.", "Finding A Response", "The project design does extend south of City Hall\u2019s southern wall, as seen in the site plan above. However, it is set back and does not project all the way to the sidewalk, as stated by the appellant. From the sidewalk, a stairway and ADA-compliant ramps lead down to the building entrance and a small landscaped plaza. At the Planning Commission hearing, there was discussion of how this projection impacts the view of the Public Safety Facility (PSF). While the pathway on the south side of City Hall would no longer have an open view of PSF, the view from the Olympic Drive sidewalk would remain open and the PSF and its plaza would be visible from the street.", "Although the proposed building is visible from Main Street at Olympic Drive, it would not be visible from the front of City Hall, or from most views along Main Street. The appellant\u2019s suggestion of a taller building might, in fact, have more visibility from Main Street than the project approved by the Planning Commission. In addition, the appellant refers to \u201cthe historically significant streetscape view of City Hall from Main Street.\u201d Staff disagrees on the historic significance of the referenced view shed, as neither the Olympic Avenue streetscape nor the PSF, which were both constructed in the current century, were present during City Hall\u2019s period of historic significance (1938-1951).", "Finding C Appeal Summary", "In approving the DRP, the Commission found that:", "The health and safety services (police, fire etc.) and public infrastructure (e.g., utilities) are sufficient to accommodate the new development in that the proposed building is located in an urbanized area already adequately served by existing City infrastructure.", "The appellant states that he is \u201cconcerned that the proposed City Services Building project plan includes the building's own water well and that the location is quite close to the Pacific Ocean, over time, this well may produce water infused with salt.  This would necessitate the inclusion of a desalination plant inside the building.\u201d  The appellant requests a cost-benefit analysis be done on this proposal.", "Finding C Response", "The CSB will be connected to the citywide water system, which will initially serve the building until the County approves use of the well and will remain as back-up if needed.  The City\u2019s Water Division is responsible for obtaining all required State and County approvals. A test well was dug in November and results indicated that water can be supplied to the building from this source. The water table accessed by this well is located well above the current level of saltwater intrusion, and data from Sea Level Rise studies recently shared with the City do not indicate that the Civic Center is vulnerable to rising water tables. However, even in the unlikely event of salt water intrusion into the groundwater source of the well, the building will be connected to the City's municipal potable water supply as a redundant system. Consequently, the City's municipal infrastructure would be sufficient to provide potable water to the building in the event that the well became inoperative for any reason.", "Finding D Appeal Summary", "In approving the DRP, the Commission found that:", "The project is generally consistent with the Municipal Code, General Plan, and Civic Center Specific Plan in that it is for the construction of a necessary government facility in the Civic Center identified in the CCSP and complies with applicable Zoning Code and CCSP requirements.", "The appellant states his concern that the proposed project conflicts with SMMC Section 5.20.060, which prohibits private sewer systems. He also disputes this finding by objecting to the locational choice for the building, claiming that \u201ctoo much is being attempted for this small footprint location.\u201d He requests a full discussion of other possible locations.", "Finding D Response", "SMMC 5.20.60 (Septic tanks, seepage pits and cesspool connections (private sewage disposal systems) was enacted to remove private, uncontrolled sewer systems in order to ensure groundwater safety. This project proposes a self-contained composting system in a public (City) building, processed by machinery that would be located in the building\u2019s basement. The unusual system is a component of the effort to achieve a zero-waste building for the Living Building Challenge.", "The appellant\u2019s claim that the finding of Code consistency cannot be made due to conflicts with this Code section is a misinterpretation of the referenced Municipal Code section. SMMC 5.20.060 does not apply to a publicly-owned waste system. Furthermore, the building will be connected to the City\u2019s municipal sewer system as a back-up for waste disposal if needed.", "Finding D addresses objective compliance with Municipal Code and General Plan requirements. The appellant\u2019s statement that the site area is too small for the project does not specifically address objective factors that support this claim. Code limitations on height and density, as well as design parameters such as setbacks and stepbacks are the most commonly used objective measures for determining whether a building \u201cfits\u201d in its proposed location. In this instance, the project is subject to CCSP standards, which support flexible building design for the public buildings that make up the Civic Center. CCSP standards reflect that the Civic Center is not a typical \u201cneighborhood\u201d in which new development directly impacts adjacent private properties. Should Council approve the proposed CCSP amendment to permit a City services building of up to 55,000 SF in the location behind City Hall, the project as approved would be consistent with the CCSP, which is the only objective standard of \u201cfit\u201d for this DRP application.", "The appellant has also challenged the choice of building location as inconsistent with the Municipal Code or the general plan. The selection of the site was made by the City Council in 2012, after public consideration of alternative sites, including the site adjacent to the north side of City Hall and other non-adjacent locations in the Civic Center. The Council chose the current site after considering all of the advantages and drawbacks of these alternatives. This process was outlined in Council staff report for the January 27, 2015 meeting. As a result, a DRP application was submitted for 1685 Main Street, and this is the only alternative that may be evaluated under this application.", "Finding G Appeal Summary", "In approving the DRP, the Commission found that:", "The project has no unacceptable adverse effects on public health or safety in that the Living Building Challenge goals that the building is designed to achieve aim to promote a higher level of well-being and community health through materials, natural light and air and other structural systems.", "The appellant challenges this finding, stating that: \u201cBecause of the possible health risks to City staff, maintenance contractors and the general public due to the potential for the spread of dangerous pathogens related to the project's Composting Toilets and the plans to spread the compost material around City Hall planting areas, we request that before any final approval is granted to this project that the City Council first direct staff to consult a professional industrial hygienist and for the consultant to prepare a report on the proposed City Services Building sewage system and compost distribution to be presented at a public meeting. In our cursory investigation and research we have found that a Composting Toilet system of this extensive capacity is unproven and does not currently exist anywhere in the United States. We have found various professional reports stating that the composting process does not reach temperature levels sufficient to kill off human pathogens and that because of this the proposed project stands to put City staff at risk.\u201d", "Finding G Response", "The appellant submitted a written comment to the Planning Commission with similar concerns during the public comment period, and Commissioners requested further explanation at the November 16th hearing. The City\u2019s Green Building Advisor addressed the Commission to explain the team\u2019s research which led to the particular aerobic composter system, which is operated in other North American buildings including the Bullitt Center in Seattle. He stated that public health and protection of employee well-being are priorities for this and any other City project. Additional information provided by the Green Building Advisor is included as Attachment F. Furthermore, the installation of the system requires a permit to be issued by the Los Angeles County Health Department.", "The appellant\u2019s claim that the compost produced from this system will be spread around City Hall landscaped areas is also incorrect; compost product is planned to be sent to a compost producer for mixture with other sources prior to its distribution and use.", "The DRP allows but does not require the composting waste system, and the project would still be in compliance with the DRP if the system were to be removed from the final plans and a traditional sewer connection provided.", "In addition to the Findings challenges, the appellant objected to three conditions of the project\u2019s approval in his appeal.", "Condition #6 Appeal Summary", "Condition 6: The proposed building has been designed to qualify for certification under the Living Building Challenge of the International Living Future Institute. Although achievement of this certification is not a condition of approval for this permit, the applicant will make every effort to endeavor to be \u201cfull LBC Certified\u201d or at least LBC \u201cpetal certified.\u201d", "The appellant\u2019s concern with this condition is that \u201cin attempting to qualify for this level of \"sustainable\" certification the City Services Building project has become \"financially\" unsustainable. We would like to see a complete cost-benefit analysis regarding the issue of \"green sustainability\" versus ultimate \"financial sustainability\" including a discussion of the long-term maintenance of the building's unproven subsystems and what taxpayers should be expected to pay for City staff office space. This analysis should include costs of recently constructed \"typical\" city office space in other southern California municipalities. As a point of reference, let us compare the presently proposed City Services Building project to the recently opened LEED Gold - African American History & Culture Museum on the National Mall in Washington DC. This new Smithsonian building is built at a very high quality and cost $270 million for 350,000 square feet. This works out to about $771 per square foot. The Santa Monica City Services Building, at its current $86 million budget and 50,000 square feet will cost more than twice as much at $1720 per square foot.\u201d", "Condition #6 Response", "The City Council's decision to authorize design of the building to qualify for certification under the Living Building Challenge of the International Living Future Institute was made at a public meeting after full consideration of costs and benefits (see January 27, 2015 Council staff report). More importantly, as long as the findings under SMMC 9.40.050 can be made for the currently contemplated design of the building, it is not necessary to condition approval of the DR Permit upon future certification or best efforts for certification. Therefore, staff is recommending that the DRP be approved without Condition 6 (see Attachment A) to avoid confusion.", "Condition #15 Appeal Summary", "Condition 15: This approval is for those plans dated August 31, 2016, as modified by the site plans presented at the Planning Commission hearing on November 16, 2016, in regard to placement of equipment, bike and vehicular parking, and solar arrays.

Project development shall be consistent with such plans, except as otherwise specified in these conditions of approval.", "The appellant states that he is concerned that \u201cthere is a rush to start the permit application process before January 1st, 2017, as apparently, earthquake codes will be changing. For the large expense of the new City Services Building per square foot, there is a concern for the reasons why these new structural steel design codes were not considered. It would seem that any new municipal building should set an example for others to follow, not to skirt. We would like to see an analysis of the reasons to \"rush\" this building and not take all new earthquake code requirements into consideration.", "Condition #15 Response", "Condition 15 is a standard condition that references the plans that the Planning Commission reviewed and approved. This plan set does not include the structural detail required by the Building and Safety Division for their plan check process. Those plans are submitted as a separate plan check application, evaluated on the basis of applicable codes. Furthermore, the DRP analysis and findings are not related to the applicant\u2019s project timing. This point of appeal is, therefore, not relevant to the referenced condition of approval.

The building, envisioned north of City Hall, was contemplated with a maximum size of 40,000 square feet, and a general height of 45 feet, with an 84-foot tower. Since that time, the number of employees working in rented office space has grown substantially. The current assessment estimates the need for 25% more office space and an integrated City Hall public counter. The City\u2019s architects and engineers considered many options and concluded that the current CCSP location for the CSB was not optimal for a number of reasons, including impacting the views of historic City Hall from the Main Street Bridge and the lack of space to accommodate the 50,000 square feet required for the consolidation of staff and operations.", "The proposed CCSP amendment would permit up to 55,000 square feet, to allow some flexibility without need to amend the CCSP again. The maximum height of 45 feet would remain the same, but the 84-foot tower would be eliminated.  This will also address concerns that the City\u2019s Landmarks Commission and other community preservation advocates have expressed for over a decade about the impact that placing a building between the Main Street Bridge and City Hall with an 84\u2019 tower element would have on the view of City Hall from the Main Street Bridge. At a May 2005 meeting, the Landmarks Commission expressed these concerns as they considered other alterations to City Hall.", "Proposed CCSP Amendment Language", "To amend the specific plan for the CSB project, figures and descriptions of the City services building and Civic Core Special Use District would be revised to remove references to the separate building along Main Street and to show instead a rear addition to City Hall as described above. The development parameters for the size and height of the City Services Building would be adjusted. The amendment would clarify that drivers to City Hall will have parking provided in the shared Civic Center public parking structure and surface lot and that bicycle parking must be provided as required by the Zoning Ordinance but with some flexibility in regard to its placement on the site.", "The existing parking lot north of City Hall, currently restricted to specifically-assigned users, would close during construction of the CSB. Following the construction period, it is anticipated that it may be repurposed or redesigned either for parking or other public purposes. The proposed CCSP language is flexible to allow inclusion of no parking, less parking or restoration of the same amount of parking as currently provided.

In the Best Case scenario, revenues would grow at a slightly higher rate approximating a 1% increase. In the Worst Case scenario, showing the potential effects of a recession, revenues would experience a 2% decrease.", "Expenditure Growth Assumptions", "All scenarios assume cost increases at the anticipated rate of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is anticipated to be 2.2% in FY 2017-18 and 2.4% in FYs 2018-22. The overall rate of growth for expenditures is 4.7%. Almost three-quarters of the General Fund operating budget is composed of labor costs, and a number of these costs, including retirement, health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation, increase at a rate that is higher than the CPI and represent significant budgetary challenges in the years to come. As in past years where the forecast shows an upcoming structural deficit, staff will work as part of the Biennial Budget process to realign spending in order ensure that the City\u2019s FY 2017-19 budget provides a financially sustainable plan.", "Retirement Costs", "The cost of pension contributions represents an ever-increasing share of local government costs, and the City has taken actions over the past several years to counteract these increases. Among these actions has been an increase in the amount that employees are required to pay towards their future benefits. At this time, Miscellaneous employees contribute up to 30% of the total contribution rate towards the cost of their retirement benefits, while Police Officers Association employees contribute up to 20% and Firefighters Local 1109 IAFF employees contribute up to 29%. Also, the City has used savings to pay down $31.4 million of its unfunded liability, and follows a policy to pay down approximately $1.3 million of its unfunded liability each year. These payments lower the City\u2019s annual contribution costs over time. In addition, the City takes advantage of a program offered by CalPERS that allows cities prepaying a portion of their total contribution at the beginning of the fiscal year to receive a discount on the amount owed. The net savings to the City of these discounts has been approximately $10.6 million through the current fiscal year.", "Despite these measures, the cost of retirement continues to rise. In December 2016, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) announced that it would lower its investment portfolio growth assumptions from 7.5% to 7.0% over three years. For public agencies like the City of Santa Monica, the new discount rate of 7.375% would take effect July 1, 2018. The discount rate would decrease to 7.25% effective July 1, 2019 and 7.0% effective July 1, 2020. Based on information from CalPERS, staff estimates that the adjustment would result in an additional increase of $1.8 million to General Fund retirement costs in FY 2018-19, increasing to $12.6million in FY2021\u201122. This change has had a severe impact on the five year projections. The City\u2019s unfunded pension liability of $387 million, along with the ratcheting down of investment earning projections, represents the most serious long-term threat to fiscal sustainability, not just in Santa Monica, but for public agencies in California.

This increase represents another severe and unanticipated impact on the City\u2019s operating expenses as previous forecasts projected a 5% annual rate of increase. The change is due to continued increases in the number of claims filed and higher permanent and temporary disability expenses. These increases are due to the City\u2019s aging workforce and increases in State-mandated permanent disability rates. The City continues to implement programs to contain workers\u2019 compensation costs, yet these projects will take some years to yield results. An Information Item published on December 12, 2016 discusses these programs. The actuarial study conducted for the Citywide Workers\u2019 Compensation Self-Insurance Fund for FY 2017-18 shows that the City will need to increase its contribution from $13.4 million to $20.5 million to maintain a responsible funding level to cover prior and current claims. The General Fund is responsible for absorbing roughly half of the $7.1 million increase, and the balance will be apportioned amongst the City\u2019s non-General Funds. The forecast includes $7.2 million from FY2014-15 savings reserved in the General Fund fund balance to offset increased workers\u2019 compensation costs over four years ($1.8 million a year) starting in FY2015\u201116.

Additional apparatus that complete the fleet include two Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicles, four Rescue Ambulances and five utility vehicles and sedans. Additionally, the front-line engine fleet is supplemented with four 1994 reserve engines and one 1998 reserve ladder truck. The reserve engines have exceeded their useful life of twenty years and at time of replacement will exceed 23 years of service; the truck will be at the end of its 20 years of service life when the new truck is delivered. It is imperative to have suitable front line apparatus to perform day-to-day response but just as important is a reserve fleet of apparatus to replace front-line apparatus in the event of scheduled preventative maintenance, equipment failure, or strike-team deployment. Based on the Fire Department\u2019s apparatus replacement analysis, experience and national standards, every effort is made to acquire and maintain the most reliable, functional and efficient apparatus that meets both the current and predicted needs of the Fire Department. Reliability of the front line and reserve fire apparatus is mission critical.

The engines carry hoses, ground ladders, wildland \ufb01re\ufb01ghting equipment, rope and technical rescue gear, lighting equipment, power tools, medical emergency equipment, and various hand tools. A Type 1 aerial ladder truck is a specialized fire apparatus equipped with an aerial ladder to provide an elevated stream capability and/or a working platform from which rescue or other firefighting related tasks can be performed.

The cost effective useful life of an apparatus varies based on geography, utilization, local environment, traffic, starting and stopping periods, workload and maintenance intervals. Apparatus lifespan and replacement intervals are based on several factors including age, mileage, and maintenance costs. The Fire Vehicle Replacement Plan assesses the maintenance to acquisition costs and uses a maintenance to acquisition ratio of 60% for moving a front-line apparatus to reserve status and when apparatus is at 100% is should move from reserve status to retirement. Typical lifespan for a truck and engine is ten years in front-line service and ten years in reserve service. However, the Department is experiencing a need to replace engines at seven to ten years based on a number of lifespan factors. The engines designated for replacement are four 1994 engines and one 2006 engine that are currently used by the Fire Department to respond to all emergency responses. The new engines will be placed into front-line service resulting in the oldest four engines being placed into reserve status. The current reserve engines will be retired. The aerial ladder truck designated for replacement was purchased in 1998.

In addition, this vehicle will respond to all emergency incidents involving the Expo line train. Unlike other jurisdictions Santa Monica Fire has one aerial ladder truck which requires a tremendous amount of equipment to be able to respond to everything from elevator rescues to incidents involving vehicle entrapments. This response capability requires all equipment to be stored and transported on one truck due to the fact an additional resource is not available within the City. The truck needs to be prepared for all emergency responses and is required to have a large amount of emergency response equipment onboard.
